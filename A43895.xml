            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE To the READER.</head>
            <p>IT may be ſome ſatisfaction to the Reader, to have an account of the Method and Deſign of this little Hiſtory, before he engages in it; which has indeed been written with ſuch pure Love to all Men, that nothing need be conceal'd from a Publick view: He may therefore be pleas'd to know in the firſt place, that the Author hereof has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the directions of that Oracle of Learning, the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> in his advancement of it: A Work worthy ſuch a Noble Pen as his, and ſuch a Royal Patron, as the firſt moſt Learned Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of Great <hi>Britain.</hi>

            </p>

               <q rend="margQuotes"> It hath much greater Life for Practice, when the Diſcourſe attendeth upon the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than when the Example attendeth upon the Diſcourſe. For this is no Point of Order (as it ſeemeth at firſt) but of Subſtance: For when the Example is the ground, being ſet down in an Hiſtory at large, it is ſet down with all circumſtances; which may ſometimes controul the Diſcourſe thereupon made, and ſometimes ſupply it, as a very patern for Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Whereas the Examples alledged for the Diſcourſes ſake, are cited ſuccinctly, and without particularity, and carry a ſervile aſpect towards the Diſcourſe, which they are brought in to make good.</q>

            <p>Though this may be of moſt Publick uſe, yet certainly 'tis much more deſirable not to purſue any particular Hiſtory at all; for fear of any miſchievous, though undeſign'd, reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Eſpecially in an Age ſo very factious. It would be more ſafe to give only ſome general Theorems, of excellent Virtue and ſordid Vice; of ſweet Peace, ſtrong <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Charity; and on the other hand of conſuming War, deſolating Diviſions, murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hatred. But this, our Noble Author, tells us will not be ſo effectual: <q rend="margQuotes">For generally Men taſte thoſe knowledges beſt, which are drench'd in Fleſh and Blood.</q> When the Virtues recommended, and the Vices diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced are embodied in the reality of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Actions.</p>
            <p>This Hiſtory of <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conſpiracy is choſen, as moſt fit to attain ſuch an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and yet to avoid the danger: It will awaken our attention, as being one of the moſt conſiderable and elaborate Treaſons that ever was; acted by the greateſt Men, controu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the wiſeſt Politicians, written by the beſt Authors that ever lived. It is alſo fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign as to all thoſe Circumſtances, which may in any wiſe ſeem to reflect; Chriſtianity it ſelf was then unborn; ſo that no Party of Men amongſt us can ſuppoſe their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerned here, otherwiſe than in what
<pb facs="tcp:103391:4"/> is ſaid to favour Moral and Eternal Truth: Then, the <hi>Roman</hi> Polity was ſo vaſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the modern Government of any Nation, that no remarks can be made, but ſuch as are common to every Man, as Citizen of the World.</p>
            <p>Yet is there (as our excellent Adviſer warns us) <q rend="margQuotes">

            <p>If any ſerious good Man ſhall phanſie a reflection, more than the general Nature of Virtue and Vice does influence; the Author proteſts his innocence, and flies to the Royal Motto, <hi>viz. Evil be to him, that Evil thinks;</hi> he thought none.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be any, to recount the Ancient Examples of Divine Vengeance: 'Tis Piety to God, and Charity to our innocent Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, when we glorifie the interpoſitions of Providence to ſupport the Governments it has eſtabliſhed, when we give inſtances of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Rebels brought to diſtreſs, of villanous Incendiaries conſumed in thoſe Flames they kindled; of Prodigals, Adulterers, Drunkards, and ſuch like laid faſt in that deſtruction, which their Debaucheries firſt made way for, and then by oppreſſing wants drove them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with a raſh ſpeed.</p>
            <p>When ever we ſee this, 'tis a piece of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural devotion, to lift up our Eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and acknowledge, There is a God that governs the World!

<pb facs="tcp:103391:6"/> ſolid Policy is built upon Eternal Righteouſneſs: And upon this account are theſe great Agents of the World here call'd, in, that they may ſerve the preſent Generation, and pay the juſt Tribute of their Teſtimony, to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme illuminator of Mankind.</p>
            <p>'Twould too much undervalue the Reader, and thoſe excellent Authors, which are here principally made uſe of, to ſuppoſe that they need any recommendation. The moſt Judicious <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and moſt Accurate <hi>Dio,</hi> the two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Grecians</hi> we are ſo oblig'd to, have been ever valued at the higheſt Rate: The <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Hiſtorian<note n="*" place="bottom">Criſpus Romanâ <hi>Primus in Hiſtoriâ.</hi> Martial Epigr.</note> 
               <hi>Criſpus Saluſt</hi> (whoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hiſtory upon this Subject required a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual attendance) obtain'd the Dignity of Primate amongſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> But whether it was out of affection and complaiſance to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or ſome invidious unkindneſs to the moſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Conſul <hi>Cicero,</hi> he hath left it ſo, that 'tis neceſſary to inſert the <hi>Catilinarian</hi> Orations at large: Which indeed deſerve their place, and challenge ſuch a Glory, as nothing, but the too eager purſuit of it in them, is able to obſcure.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem a raſh attempt to venture upon Tranſlating thoſe incomparable pieces of <hi>Roman</hi> Oratory, and the Author here is ſenſible how their great Spirit often languiſhes in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; but this muſt not be imputed to the defects either of our Age or Language, which
<pb facs="tcp:103391:7"/> are now able to equal any thing, the Soul of Man ever produced: And that the Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here may not too much reflect, this Author acknowledges and begs Pardon that he has allowed himſelf to be ſometimes weary of this, which is the more drudging ſort of ſtudy, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too intent upon the real Hiſtory, and the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Remarks: Yet it may poſſibly appear by ſome places, that others might have been rendred with advantage enough.</p>
            <p>However were there nothing here but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced remains of Antiquity, Monuments of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Ruſt, yet we have amongſt us, thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Heroes, who, both for Learning and Virtue, for rais'd and excellent Spirits, do equal if not exceed the <hi>Roman</hi> greatneſs: 'Twas their Honour to have riffled <hi>Greece,</hi> and 'twas juſtly acknowledged to them to have done ſo; we muſt not therefore be ſo injurious to the preſent Age as to ſuppreſs that Glory which is due to it in the Spoils of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>By theſe Tranſactions were the People filled with the dread of the Plot, and the face of the City was changed, from the higheſt Jollity and Wantonneſs which a ſerene Peace had foſtered, they fell into a ſudden conſternation; they did not know what place

Whither at length will your unbridled Impudence arrive? Are the extraordinary Guards of the Palace nothing to you? The ſtrict Watch of the City, nothing? The Fears of the People, nothing? Doth the concourſe of all good Men, this ſtrong and Sacred place in which the Senate is met, the Preſence of this Aſſembly, nothing move you? Do not you ſee that your Counſels are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected? Don't you perceive that the belief of your Conſpiracy is written upon the Countenances of moſt here? Do you think us ignorant of what you did laſt Night? What the Night before? Where you met? Whom you called together? What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult you came to? O Times! O Manners! The
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103391:37"/> Senate knows all this, the Conſul ſees it, and yet the Traytor lives. Lives! Ay, and comes into the Senate, partakes of the Publick Counſel, Obſerves, and Marks out with his Eye which of us he deſigns to Murder. But we think our ſelves Couragious enough, and to have given ſufficient Satisfaction to the Common-wealth, if we can but avoid his Rage and Weapons. No, this muſt not be all: You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>Catiline,</hi> long ago to have been put to death by the Conſular Command, to have fallen into the deſtruction which you had been ſo diligently preparing for us all. Did that Excellent Perſon, <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> the Chief Prieſt, being yet a Private Man, kill <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> who made but a ſmall diſturbance? And ſhall we Conſuls permit <hi>Catiline</hi> who deſign'd to fill the whole Earth with ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and deſtruction, to go unpuniſhed? I need not inſiſt on that Ancient Preſident of <hi>Quintus Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Ahala,</hi> who ſlew with his own Hand <hi>Sp. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> for but deſigning to alter the Government. This, this was the Ancient Valour in the Common wealth, that our Heroick Anceſtors would ſuppreſs a pernicious Citizen with more ſevere Puniſhments than the fierceſt Enemy. We have a Decree for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and weighty, already made againſt you, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline:</hi> The Common-wealth doth not want Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, nor this State Authority: No, no, I ſpeak plainly, we the Conſuls are deficient.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It was formerly Decreed by the Senate, that <hi>Lucius Opimius</hi> the Conſul ſhould take care that the Common-wealth might be Preſerved; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon which he cauſed <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of a good Family, to be Executed, being but ſuſpected of Seditious Practices: So alſo <hi>M. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> who was of Conſular Dignity, with his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103391:37"/> Children, were put to death. Another preſident for this we have, when by a like Decree, the Common-wealth was committed to <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Valerius</hi> the Conſuls; and was there one Day paſſed, before death and the juſt vengeance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth overtook <hi>Lucius Saturninus</hi> Tribune of the People, and <hi>Caius Servilius</hi> the Praetor: Yet is this the Twentieth Day that we have permitted the Power of theſe Laws and Examples to languiſh. We have a Decree conformable to theſe preſidents up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record, which yet lies dormant in the Rolls ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in its own Sheath, by which 'tis requiſite for you <hi>Catiline</hi> to die: Yet you ſtill live, and live, not to repent of, but to increaſe your impudence. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, O Conſcript Fathers, to be merciful, but not ſlothful in ſo great dangers of the Common-wealth: And now it is that I condemn my ſelf of backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and neglect. A Rebellion is raiſed in <hi>Italy</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Confines of <hi>Etruria,</hi> againſt the State; the Number of the Enemies increaſe daily: Yet doth the Commander of all theſe Rebel-forces, the Head of their Conſpiracy, remain within the City Walls, and contrive our deſtruction in the very Senate. If I ſhould now ſeize you <hi>Catiline,</hi> and command you to be put to death, I doubt not but all good men would look upon my proceedings as too ſlow, not as too ſevere and cruel. But I will not do it yet; I will ſtay a little longer, and will then deliver you to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, (and not till then) when there ſhall be no Man however corrupt, extravagant, and like your ſelf, that will not acknowledge it a juſt deed. As long as there is any ſo ſtupid or impudent; as to ſtand up for your defence you may live: But it ſhall be ſo as you now live, compaſſed about with ſuch Guards, as you may not be able to effect any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103391:38"/> thing againſt the publick Safety. Many Eyes will be upon you, many Ears imployed to hearken out your deſigns, and not a few (as they have always done) will ſtill continue to obſerve your moſt ſecret machinations.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What is it O <hi>Catiline</hi> that you can expect, ſeeing neither the darkneſs of the Night can obſcure your horrid Deſigns, or keep your Seditious meetings ſecret; neither the moſt retired place of your Houſes conceal your Conſultations, and traiterous agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Seeing all of them are plainly detected; all diſcovered: For once be adviſed by me; change your Mind, take other Meaſures; blot the black Characters of Ruine, Murder, and Rapine out of your Mind: We have you every way: Your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and intents are all perfectly diſcloſed; which if you pleaſe you might now with me recognize: Don't you remember that upon XII <hi>Cal. Novem.</hi> I infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Senate that on a certain Day, <hi>viz.</hi> before the VI. <hi>Cal. Nov. C. Manlius</hi> that Prodigy of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, and your Creature, would be in Arms: Did that intelligence fail me, <hi>Catiline?</hi> I did not only diſcover ſo great, ſo cruel, ſo incredible an enterprize, but that which is more to be admired, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly told the very Day. I ſaid the ſame in the Senate, that you intended the Maſſacre of the Nobility up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on V. <hi>Kal. Nov.</hi> when many of the chief men of the City ſhould be gone from <hi>Rome,</hi> not ſo much for their own ſafety as to defeat your Deſigns. Can you deny that when you ſaw your ſelf hemm'd in with Guards, by my appointment, ſet to obſerve you; ſo that you could effect nothing againſt the publick ſafety, and perceiving that many were gone out of the City, you ſaid to ſome of your fellow Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that you would be content with the ſlaughter
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103391:38"/> of us who ſtaid behind. What? when you expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Praeneſte</hi> ſhould on the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>November</hi> be ſurprized in the Night time, did you then know that it was fortified and defended with ſtrength ſufficient by my care? There is none of your debates, reſolutions, and moſt ſecret intentions, which I am not pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually informed of, and do not perfectly underſtand.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Call to mind with me what was done t'other Night, and you will ſoon perceive that I am more diligent and watchful to preſerve then you are to deſtroy the State. I ſay that the night before laſt, you went with a Company of arm'd Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians (for I will diſcover all) into the Houſe of <hi>M. Lecca,</hi> that there were alſo congregated ſeveral of your Aſſociates in this wickedneſs; dare you deny this? Or will you ſay nothing? I will prove every Tittle, if you have the Confidence to contradict it. For I ſee ſeveral in the Senate who were there with you. O immortal Powers! What an Age do we live in? How is the Common-wealth governed? In what City are we. Here, even here among our ſelves, O Conſcript Fathers, in this moſt Sacred, moſt Grave, and moſt Wiſe Aſſembly of the whole Earth, are thoſe now ſitting who Plot my death and the deſtruction of us all, intend to raze this City, and in it the Empire of the whole World. Theſe I the Conſul behold here, and ask their Counſel for the Common-wealth: Thoſe who deſerved Death long ago I have not yet impeached. You were, O <hi>Catiline,</hi> at <hi>Lecca</hi>'s that Night; you then diſtributed <hi>Italy</hi> among your ſelves, allotted to every one ſome place over which he ſhould praeſide; choſe out ſome to leave behind at <hi>Rome,</hi> others to take with you; divided the City into ſeveral Parts for carrying on
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103391:39"/> the Fire: Determined immediatly to go hence; and declared that nothing remained to be effected in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to your departure, but my Death. For which, you ſoon found two <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, who to eaſe you of that care, offered themſelves, undertaking to murder me the ſame Night in my Bed. Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult was ſcarce broken up, before I was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with theſe reſolves: Whereupon I put my ſelf into a poſture of defence and fortified my Houſe: refuſed thoſe entrance who came thither about break of Day, to give me the good morrow from you: Having told ſeveral very conſiderable Perſons what time ſuch would come, and what their Errand was.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Therefore I will thus adviſe you, <hi>Catiline,</hi> go on as you have begun; but you muſt withdraw from the City: The Gates are open: None will compel your ſtay. The <hi>Manlian</hi> Forces have too long wanted their General; go to them, but, be ſure, carry your whole party, (at leaſt as many as you can) with you, purge the City. If I once get theſe Walls between us, I ſhall be freed of my greateſt fears. I will allow you ſo much advantage, but that you ſhould be any longer with us, I cannot bear, cannot ſuffer, cannot endure. Let us give our moſt hearty thanks to the immortal Gods, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>Jupiter Stator</hi> the Defender and Patron of this moſt ancient City, for that we have ſo often eſcaped ſo dreadful, ſo horrible, ſo dangerous, and ſo peſtilent a Conſpiracy. <hi>The whole ſafety of the Common-wealth ought not to be often ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded upon the account of one Man.</hi> 'As long as your deſigns were laid againſt me being only Conſul Elect, I did not defend my ſelf with the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103391:39"/> publick Arms, but by my own private care. When at this laſt Conſular Election you plotted to kill me being then Conſul, together with your competitors I defeated all your nefarious endeavours by the help and aſſiſtance of my Friends without any Publick ſtirs; as often as you made attempts upon my Life, ſo often I oppoſed you with my own Strength: Although I foreſaw that my fall would give a great blow to the Common-wealth. But now you openly ſeek the ruine of the whole State, deſign to deſtroy the Temples of the immortal Gods, demoliſh this City, murder the Citizens, and lay waſt all <hi>Italy:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing I cannot at preſent act according as (by ancient preſidents of the Empire) I might juſtly do; I will do that which has leſs of ſeverity, but is far more conducing to the Publick good. If I cauſe you to be executed, the Seeds of your Sedition will yet remain in the midſt of us; but if (as I have often exhorted you) you go away, your Comrades, the great and noiſom Sink of the Common-wealth, will be drain'd out of the City. What is it that you ſtick at, <hi>Catiline?</hi> Are you unwilling to do what you had before determined, now I command it? The Conſul requires an Enemy to withdraw out of the City: Do you enquire whether I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you into Exile? I enjoin it not, but I would perſuade you to it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. For what is it, O <hi>Catiline,</hi> that you can now delight in at <hi>Rome?</hi> Where there is not one Perſon except ſuch profligate Wretches as are of your own Gang, but avoid and hate you. What Mark of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Wickedneſs is there which is not conſpicuouſly branded on you? Doth not all infamy cleave to your Name? What Luſt ever eſcaped your Eye? What Villany your Hand? What Vice is there that hath
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103391:40"/> not ſeized your whole Body? What Youth, by you drawn into Vice, whom you have not hardned in impudence, drench'd in Luſt, and inur'd to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? And even lately upon the Death of your firſt Wife, did not you ſlay your own Son, and heap one incredible Villany upon another to make way for your ſecond Nuptials? But I ſhall paſs by this, leſt I ſhould diſgrace this City by mentioning ſuch an horrid Impiety to have been in it, and not to have been ſufficiently puniſhed: I omit to mention the ruines of your Eſtate, which now hang over you, and will quite cruſh you by the next <hi>Ides.</hi> I will only inſiſt upon ſuch things as concern, not your own private Debaucheries, and filthineſs, not your ſtraits and wants, but the ſafety and welfare of the Common-wealth, and every one here preſent. Can you take any content in living here? Can this Air be pleaſant to you, when you know that there is none of us ignorant, that you came to the Election upon the Day before the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> when <hi>Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and <hi>Tullus</hi> were Conſuls, armed with a Dart, ready to ſlay the Conſuls and Chief men of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And that you were not prevented by any fear, or terrour occaſioned by the horridneſs of the Fact, (no, there was no room for that in your deſperate Breaſt,) but by the good fortune of the Common-wealth? But I ſhall inſiſt no longer on theſe actions, they are known publickly and are ſtill freſh in every ones Memory. How many times did you endeavour to take away my Life when I was Conſul Elect? How often when I was actually in that Office? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your attempts which ſeemed inevitable, have I fruſtrated, how often have I put by the very fatal thruſt? There are none of your contrivances, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, or machinations, of which I have not a perfect
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103391:40"/> knowledge; yet will you not ceaſe to meditate and endeavour our deſtruction. How often hath your Dagger been wreſted out of your Hands? How often hath it fall'n, as it were ſlipt out of your Hands by chance? Yet can you not be without it: What Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies you have uſed in the Conſecration of it I know not, but ſure I am, you eſteem your ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity to murder the Conſul therewith.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Now what ſort of life do you think to lead? For I ſpeak now not as inflamed with hatred which you have deſerved, but as moved with pity, which you have no way merited. You came juſt now into the Senate: Who was there, in ſo great a Company, among ſo many of your Friends and intimate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that afforded you a Salutation? If the like never happened in the memory of Man; what need is there of an open reprimand, ſeeing you are already condemned by great ſilence? What was the cauſe that at your entrance, theſe Seats were left empty? That all thoſe of conſular Dignity, mark'd out for deſtruction by you, as ſoon as you ſat down removed from the places which were near you, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious? How do you think to bear this? Certainly if my ſervants did thus avoid me, as all theſe worthy Citizens do you, I ſhould believe it high time to leave my Houſe: and do you think the City a place for you? If I were ſo ſhrewdly ſuſpected and attainted by my Countrey-men as you are, I ſhould chooſe rather to go into a voluntary Exile, than abide the hateful and eſtranged looks of my fellow-Citizens. How can you be ſo bold as to continue in the preſence of thoſe to whom you are ſo offenſive, who are ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed at your ſight; and whoſe hate your own Conſcience tells you is moſt juſtly fix'd upon you? If your Parents ſhunn'd and hated you, and would
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103391:41"/> be reconcil'd upon no Terms, I believe you would haſten out of their ſight: Now your Countrey the common Parent of us all abhors you, and looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you as deſigning nothing, but unnaturally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her, yet will you neither ſtand in aw of their Authority, obey their commands, nor fear their force. And now, <hi>Catiline,</hi> ſhe thus ſeems ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to plead with you: <hi>No Crime hath been publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed of late years in which you have not had an Hand; no wickedneſs, but of your contriving: You have been continually murdering your fellow Citizens, ruining and deſtroying your Companions, yet are you unpuniſhed; you have not only ſet your ſelf to neglect, but alſo to break and over-throw the Laws. All your paſt offences, though ſcarce tolerable, I bore as well as poſſibly I could; but now I am wholly endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd for your ſake alone; No deſigns laid againſt me, but what have their riſe from</hi> Catiline; <hi>this is not to be endured. Depart therefore and ſet me free, from my fears; that if they have a juſt Foundation, I may not be oppreſſed, if they are only groundleſs Suſpicions I may be eaſed of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Now then that your Countrey doth thus expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate with you, ought ſhe not to obtain her requeſt although ſhe uſe no force? What? will you plead, that to avoid Suſpicion you proffered to reſide in the Houſe of M. <hi>Lepidus?</hi> by whom being refuſed, you had the impudence to come to me, and deſire that I would keep you in my Houſe. When I had told you that I could not be ſafe under the Roof of the ſame Houſe with you, ſeeing I was in ſuch great danger from your being within the Walls of the ſame City; you went to <hi>Q. Metellus</hi> the Praetor, who alſo rejected you: Then did you reſort to your old Friend, honeſt <hi>M. Marcellus,</hi> whom you could
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103391:41"/> not but think could diligently keep, carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, very couragiouſly puniſh you. But how far can he be from Bonds, and Impriſonment, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious of his own guilt ſeeks to be taken into Cuſtody? Seeing affairs ſtand thus, and you cannot with any content remain here, is it not your beſt way, <hi>Catiline,</hi> to go to ſome other Countrey, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote that life which is thus delivered from condign Puniſhment, to Exile and Solitude? Move it you ſay, to the Senate, and if they command you into Exile, then you declare you will be gone. I will not propoſe that, it being contrary to my manner, yet will I do ſo much, that you may perceive what their judgment is: Go out of the City, <hi>Catiline,</hi> deliver the Common-wealth from their fears: if you expect I ſhould ſpeak plainer, depart into Exile: What think you now, <hi>Catiline?</hi> Do you take notice of, do you conſider the ſilence of all preſent? They are of the ſame mind, none contradict the propoſal Why do you expect that they ſhould ſpeak to you, when you may perceive their Minds by their ſilence? Should I ſpeak thus to this brave Youth <hi>P. Sextius</hi> or to the excellent <hi>M. Marcellus,</hi> the Senate would certainly, and might juſtly lay hands on Me, though Conſul, in this very place. But by not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting they approve of what I adviſe you to; by ſuffering, they deſire it, by ſilence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim their aſſent. Neither are the Senators, (whoſe judgment you pretend to value, but whoſe lives you cheaply devote to ruine) only of this Mind, the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights alſo, honeſt and brave men, the whole Body of the Citizens who attend the Senate diſcover themſelves: They get together, adviſe, threaten: As you may have obſerved. Theſe I can ſcarce with-hold from aſſaulting, and tearing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103391:42"/> you in pieces, yet can I perſuade them to bring you on your way when you depart from this place (which you once thought to deſtroy and ruine,) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City Gates.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. But what is it I am arguing? as if any thing could move you! as if you could be brought to take better courſes: is it poſſible to perſuade you to think of departing hence? Would the gods gave you ſuch a Mind! Yet I foreſee that, if moved by my word, you ſhould go into Exile, how great a Tempeſt of Envy is like to fall upon us, which, though it be at preſent diverted by a ſenſe of your wickedneſs, may, when Poſterity hath forgot that, fall upon my head. Yet doth this private calamity nothing move me, ſo it be not accompanied with publick loſs. It is in vain to exhort you to conſider the heinouſneſs of your Vices, to fear the juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of the Laws, and yield to the neceſſities of the Common-wealth; for you are ſuch an one, <hi>Catiline,</hi> as neither ſhame can with-hold from filthy deeds, nor fear deter from deſperate undertakings, neither can Reaſon moderate your unreaſonable fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Therefore (as I have oft adviſed you) depart; and if you will faſten your envy upon me, whom you account, your moſt mortal Enemy, go into Exile, then ſhall I be ſcarce able to ſtem the common cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; if you do go; and if it be by the command of the Conſul alone, I ſhall very hardly ſupport the weight of that envy. But if you had rather make an acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to my glory, go forth with the reſt of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched, bloody Aſſociates; convey your ſelf to <hi>Maulius;</hi> encourage thoſe miſerable Citizens; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate your ſelf from all good men; raiſe War in the Heart of your own Countrey; triumph in your Plunderings, and Robberies, that you may not be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103391:42"/> accounted thruſt out by me among Strangers, but may ſeem willingly to have retired to your own party. But why do I thus perſuade? When I know you have ſent all things requiſite before hand, and how many armed men ſtay for you at the <hi>Aurelian forum?</hi> When I know the Day is agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and <hi>Manlius,</hi> and by you the Silver Eagle (which I truſt ſhall be fatal both to you, and your accomplices, which at your Houſe, the Sanctuary of all your Wickedneſs was conſecrated) is alſo ſent? Would you any longer want that which you were wont to adore, when you went forth to your Murders? Before whoſe Altars you were wont to lift up your right Hand, ready to be imbrued in the Blood of the Citizens?</p>
                     <p n="10">10. At length go thither, where your unbridled fury hath been long hurrying you; yet are you not at all griev'd but much delighted. This madneſs you imbib'd with your Nature, nouriſhed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to it, and fortune by favouring you in it hath made it much greater; Peace was never like to pleaſe you, nor could you love War except it were wicked and unjuſt. You have got together a Rout of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate miſcreants, vile Perſons, who have not only loſt their Eſtates, but are deprived of all hopes of a recruit. Among theſe in what compleat joys and pleaſures may you carouſe, when in all your number you ſhall not have ſo much as the reſtraining look of one good Man? To this ſort of life you have inur'd your ſelf, by your continual laborious Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies: You have taken up your Lodging upon the Ground, not meerly to intrigue an Adultery, but to perpetrate a Murder: You are accuſtomed to watch, not only to deſcry the ſecurity of abuſed Husbands, but alſo to prey upon their Goods, when you have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103391:43"/> ſlain them. You have an opportunity to ſhew your great fortitude in enduring Hunger, Cold, and Want, which you may ſufficiently feel in a ſhort time: I did by putting you beſide the Conſulſhip gain this Point, that all your fury will be ſpent in Baniſhment to contrive our ruine; but you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have thoſe opportunities to effect it, which you muſt have enjoyed, had you carried the Election: And that your riſing will be rather termed Plundring than War.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Now, O Conſcript Fathers! conſider diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and revolve in your minds what I ſay, while I endeavour to anſwer an Objection my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey might make againſt me; if my Countrey (which is ever dearer to me then my life) if all</hi> Italy, <hi>if the whole Common-wealth ſhould thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt me:</hi> What haſt thou done O <hi>M. Tullius?</hi> Him whom thou haſt found the publick Enemy, the Head of the Conſpiracy, who thou knoweſt, hath Liſted broken Citizens and the meaneſt Vaſſals; and is the Author of all our Dangers; haſt thou thus ſent him away out of the City, that he might be the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to come againſt it? Why did you not ſecure him in the ſtrongeſt Fetters? Deliver him to be put to Death, and inflict the juſteſt, that is, the greateſt puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? What could hinder you? not want of preſidents; for how often have Traiterous Citizens been killed by private men? Did the Laws concerning puniſhment of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens obſtruct it? Never was any ſuffered to enjoy the Priviledge of a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, being convicted of Treaſon. Do you ſtand in fear of the envy of Poſterity? You do very worthily indeed, and grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requite the <hi>Roman</hi> People who raiſed you, a private Man of mean Quality of a ſudden through all the Degrees of Honour to the top of Government, if for fear of Envy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103391:43"/> or Danger, you neglect the publick ſafety of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens? But if you have any reaſon to fear Envy, is that which ariſeth from fortitude, and ſtrictneſs, or that from ſloth and timorouſneſs moſt formidable? When <hi>Italy</hi> is waſted, and deſtroyed with War, the Houſes demoliſh'd and Cities burnt, Do you think you will not then be more hated?</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Give me leave now to anſwer in a few words that Sacred Voice and thoſe who are of this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If I thought, O Conſcript Fathers, that it were beſt for the Common-wealth, the Traytor ſhould not live an Hour; for if the braveſt men, and moſt famous Citizens, were ſo far from defiling themſelves with the Blood of <hi>Saturninus,</hi> of the <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> of <hi>Flaccus</hi> and ſeveral others, that they got reputation by deſtroying them; certainly I have no cauſe to fear the Cenſure of Poſterity for putting to Death this grand parricide. But granting that I ſhould incur their utmoſt Envy; it hath always been my Maxim, that <hi>Envy procur'd by Virtue, is Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and not Envy.</hi> But there are many among us, who either do not ſee our Dangers, or elſe diſſemble what they ſee; who by ſoft Cenſures nouriſh the hopes of <hi>Catiline,</hi> and by not believing, feed the Infant Conſpiracy: Who, followed by many well meaning, but unobſerving men, if I ſhould have acted ſeverely againſt <hi>Catiline</hi> would cry out of Cruel, and Arbitrary proceedings. But if he go to the Camp of <hi>Manlius,</hi> as he did intend, none will be ſo fooliſh as not evidently to perceive a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, none ſo wicked as to deny it. So that if we now cut off this one Head, it will be no more but only a ſhort ſuppreſſion, not an utter extirpation of the miſchief. But if he departs, and takes his pack'd Company of profligate, neceſſitous Villains
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103391:44"/> along with him, not only this ſo ripe a Plot will he defeated, but the very Stock and Original of all publick evils will be eradicated and deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. We have been a long time, O Conſcript Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, perplext with theſe treaſonable Deſigns, and lurking Snares, but (however it comes to paſs) all theſe old Intrigues, Impieties, and Treaſons, are now come to Maturity in the time of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip. If we take off this chief of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy only, we may indeed flatter our ſelves with a temporary cure of it, but the poiſonous infection will ſtill remain, as it were in the Veins and Bowels of the Common-wealth. As Perſons in an high Feaver, ſeem at firſt refreſht with a draught of coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Water, but the Diſeaſe doth by and by rage, and burn the more, ſo this diſtemper in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth may ſeem a little abated by his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſoon recovering ſtrength, will break forth more violently in thoſe who yet remain. Therefore, O Conſcript Fathers, let theſe infected Perſons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the Society of thoſe who are yet ſound, let the City Walls, as I have oft deſired, be once between us, let all the Traytors herd together, that they may at length ceaſe to attempt the Murder of the Conſul in his own Houſe, may no longer beſet the Praetors Judicature, or with their Swords ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the Senate, nor prepare Fire-balls for burning the City. Let it now appear, as if it were written in his Forehead, what every Citizen thinks of the Common-wealth. 'Methinks, I can promiſe my ſelf, and you, O Conſcript Fathers, ſuch an indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable diligence in us Conſuls, ſo prevalent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in you, ſo great a Virtue and Valour in the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, and ſo unanimous an Agreement of all good men, that <hi>Catiline</hi> being once gone, all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103391:44"/> his deſigns will appear unmask'd, defeated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd. With theſe Omens, go <hi>Catiline</hi> to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and horrid War; go, and may it be to the ſafety of the Common-wealth, but to thy ruine, and to the ruine of all thoſe who have united themſelves to thee in this Treaſon. And now O <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whoſe Temple as well as this City was Conſecrated by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> and whom we truly call the Saviour of this Place and Empire; exclude him and his Aſſociates, from thy Altars, and all other Temples, from the Houſes, and Walls of this City, from the lives and fortunes of the Citizens: All the Enemies of good men, Traytors to their Countrey, deſtroyers of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Covenanted and Aſſociated among themſelves by their Villanies, do thou proſecute Living and Dead with thine eternal puniſhments.</p>

Being driven from the City, he has loſt that advantageous Spot upon which he ſtood; he is now an open Enemy, and none can deny but the War againſt him is juſt. No doubt but we undid the Man and obtain'd a brave Victory, when we drove him out of his lurking Treachery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to apparent Treaſon. But that he was forc't to carry away with him (ſo contrary to his wiſhes) his Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger unſtain'd with our Blood. That he left us alive behind him. That we have wreſted the Sword out of his Hand, that the Citizens are ſav'd, and the City
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103391:47"/> ſtanding; you cannot imagine how great his Sorrows are, how he is broken and ſubdued by them. Now, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> he lies, as it were, proſtrate at your Feet; he feels the blow and the fall, caſts back his envious Eyes and weeps over this City for having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued out of his devouring Jaws. But ſhe ſeems to me refreſh't and to rejoice having eaſed her Stomach of ſuch a deſtructive Poiſon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if there be any of you (as indeed you ought all to be) concern'd, that I ſhould now glory and triumph in this for which I ought to be ſeverely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, as not ſeizing upon, but promoting the eſcape of ſuch a Capital Enemy; Know, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> that it is not my fault, the times won't bear it. <hi>Catiline</hi> ought long ago to have been executed to have been brought to condign puniſhment. This, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the cuſtoms of our Anceſtors, the exact Juſtice of this Empire, the Publick Intereſt have required at my hands: But how many think you, would have diſcredited all that I had related? how many by a ſtupid eaſineſs would have remain'd unapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the Treaſon? How many would have favour'd it? How many corrupted with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Principles, would have even juſtified it? But for all this could I have thought that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him off, would have ſufficiently ſeem'd you from all danger; I had long ago, not only ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd the envy of it, but readily offer'd my own Life to the opportunities of Sacrificing his, But when I ſaw that notwithſtanding there was ſuch clear proof made before you all, yet if I had puniſht him (as he deſerv'd) with Death, I ſhould have been ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with Envy, that I had not been able to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Complices; I brought it to ſuch a Head that you needed not openly engage, before he appeared, an
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103391:48"/> open Enemy. This Enemy of ours, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> how much he is to be feared now he is abroad, you may apprehend by this, that nothing, troubles me more than his quitting the City with ſo ſmall a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: Would he had led out all his Forces with him. He carried away <hi>Tongillus,</hi> whoſe very Childhood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came infamous by his love. He took alſo <hi>Publicius</hi> and <hi>Munatius,</hi> whoſe pittiful Debts in every Tavern did ſo oppreſs them that there was no fear, they could make any ſtir to the miſchief of the Common-wealth. But then, what conſiderable Perſons has he left behind him? Indeed deeply engag'd in Debt; but withal, both how powerful and how noble they are, you your ſelves know.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As therefore for that Army of his, which he has collected, conſiſting of ſome old Deſperado's, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd Ruſticks and broken Tenants; ſuch, who chooſe to follow his Camp, meerly to avoid the proceſs of Law; who are ready to run away not only at the appearance of our Forces, but even at the Praetors Edict; theſe are very contemptible in reſpect of our <hi>Gallicane</hi> Legions of thoſe that <hi>Q. Metellus</hi> has liſted in the <hi>Picenian</hi> and <hi>Gallick</hi> Countrey, of thoſe that we continually Muſter at home. But the Gentlemen I ſee running up and down the <hi>Forum,</hi> ſtanding in the Court, ſitting in the very Senate, perfumed with Odours, adorn'd in Purple; theſe I could alſo wiſh he had carried out for his Souldiers with him. Who if they continue here, know for certain, are much more to be dreaded, though abſent from the Army, than the Army is, which he has with him. And this proves how much they are to be fear'd; they are ſenſible I know their Intrigues, yet care not for all that. I know, to whom <hi>Apulia</hi> is aſſign'd, who is to have <hi>Etruria,</hi> who the <hi>Picene</hi> Countrey, who the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103391:48"/> 
                        <hi>Gallick,</hi> who it was that begg'd for his part the City-management of the Maſſacre and Fire. They are ſenſible, that all the reſolves of the Night before laſt have been brought to me; that I yeſterday diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd them in the Senate; <hi>Catiline</hi> himſelf trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and fled upon it, What do theſe Men preſume upon? I'le aſſure them they are much miſtaken, if they ſuppoſe my former Lenity muſt be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That which I have all along labour'd for, I have now obtain'd, that all of you might behold this Plot againſt the Government made apparent: Unleſs any of you can imagine that theſe who are ſo like <hi>Catiline</hi> are not of <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Mind. And if you do think ſo, yet know however there can now be no allowance to ſuch favourable Surmiſes, the affair it ſelf importunes us to be ſevere: Yet one thing will I ſtill grant them; that they may be gone; Oh! let them go; and not ſuffer poor <hi>Catiline</hi> to languiſh for them. I'le tell them the way, he is gone the <hi>Aurelia</hi> Road, if they will but make haſt, they'l reach him before Night. Oh bleſſed ſtate, if the ſink of this City was but once well drain'd! Since the empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it only of <hi>Catiline</hi> has given ſo great eaſe and refreſhment. For what miſchief and villany can be invented or contriv'd that he did not deſign upon us? What poiſoning Artiſt is there in <hi>Italy,</hi> what deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fencer, what Hector, what <hi>Aſſaſſine,</hi> what Murderer, what Forgerer, what Cheat, what Bully, what Whoremaſter, what Baud, what Pimp, what Proſtitute, what ruin'd Wretch can be found who does not preſently profeſs himſelf of <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Club? What Murder has there been of late, and he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it? What villanous rape without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance? Was there ever ſuch another Artiſt in debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery?
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103391:49"/> Sometimes he was Maſter of the unnatural Amours, ſometimes Miſtreſs; to ſome he promiſed the enjoyment of a Luſt, to others the Death of a Father, which was accompliſhed not only by his perſuaſion, but aſſiſtance. And now, what a Number of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Rogues has he got together both from City and Countrey? There was not one Bankrupt in <hi>Rome,</hi> not one neceſſitous Raſcal in any Corner of <hi>Italy,</hi> but what he hath drawn into the Confederacy of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Treaſon.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But to purſue his various Methods; you mayobſerve how he hits each inclination with a proper difference: If in the Fencing School any one be more than ordinarily daring, he ſhall preſently boaſt himſelf <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Crony; if the Stage produces any one extreamly ſoft and lecherous, he brags of <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>'s moſt agreeable Acquaintance. And this brave Patron of theirs long accuſtom'd to the exerciſe of Whoring and Rapine, being inur'd to Cold and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to Thirſt and Watching is ſtill cried up by them as hardy and valiant; though in truth theſe ſupports of Valour and advantages for Virtue, are long ago conſum'd by his rage and intemperance. Such as he is, had all his Aſſociates attended him; had all the ſcandalous croud of Debauches quitted the Town when he did: Oh bleſſed People! Oh happy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment! Oh the unparallel'd Glory of my Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip! For as the World now goes, there is no ſuch thing as a reſtrained Luſt, a humane and tolerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue: Nothing now, but Maſſacre, and Fire, and Rapine: The have ſpent their Patrimonies, treated away their Eſtates; their Stock has been long conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and of late their Credit has been quite crackt, yet their Luſts are the ſame they were in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affluence. If after all they deſir'd nothing but to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103391:49"/> Drink and Game, to Guttle, and Wench, we might eſteem them wretched, but poſſibly not intolerable: Whereas now, who can bear it, that theſe ſloathful Cowards ſhould continually plot againſt the moſt Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men? the moſt Senſleſs againſt the moſt Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Sots againſt the Sober, the Sluggards againſt the Vigilant? Who ſit at a Banquet embracing their impudent Miſſes, with heavy Heads and loaded Stomachs, crown'd with Garlands, ſmeer'd with Ointments, enfeebled with Lechery, and then in the midſt of their Diſcourſe do they belch out the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of good Men, and the firing of the City. I cannot but aſſure my ſelf, there is ſome preſent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hanging over their Heads; and that thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, which have been long due to their Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Treaſon, to their Luſt and Debauchery, are either now treading upon their Heels, or not far from them. Theſe, if my Conſulſhip (being not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form) ſhall root out; it will prolong this Empire, not for a little uncertain time, but to a ſteddy ſucceſſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages. There is no Nation, that we need dread, no King that dare make War upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: All things abroad, Sea and Land are ſecur'd by the Virtue of one General. But there is a War at our own Doors, Treachery at Home, Danger en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing us on every ſide, the Enemy within us: We are now to engage againſt Luxury, Rage, Rebellion. This is the War, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> in which I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my ſelf your General; I willingly load my ſelf with the enmity of every miſchievous Villain. What can be cur'd, I will by any means reſtore: But what muſt be cut off, I will not ſuffer to ſpread to our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ruine. Wherefore let them be gone, or be quiet: Or, if they will ſtill ſtay in the City and retain their former Principles; let them expect to ſuffer, what they ſo much deſerve.</p>

                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:103391:50"/>6. But ſome there are, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> who report that <hi>Catiline has been by me driven into Baniſhment.</hi> If ſpeaking would do it, I would preſently ſend them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. For he, certainly, is a very timorous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly modeſt Man, not able to bear a Conſular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand; ſo that ſo ſoon as ever he was but bid to go into Exile, he immediately obeyed and acquieſc'd, Yeſterday when I was juſt upon being ſtabb'd in my own Houſe, I call'd a Senate in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Stator;</hi> I inform'd the Conſcript Fathers of the whole Affair. Whither, when <hi>Catiline</hi> came, what Sena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or was there, that ſo much as ſpoke to him? Who ſaluted him? Who look'd upon him otherwiſe than a moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Citizen, or rather a moſt dangerous Enemy? Nay, thoſe Noble Perſons who were of his Quality, left that Bench empty and naked, upon which he ſate. And now, I am the cruel Conſul that baniſh Men with a word: I did but ask <hi>Catiline,</hi> whether he had a Nocturnal Conſult at <hi>Lecca</hi>'s, or No. When he (whoſe Forehead never fail'd him before) was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd in Conſcience that he at firſt ſtood mute: Then I proceeded to diſcover; what he had done that Night, where he had been, what he had reſolved upon for the next. Then I gave a plain Deſcription of the whole Deſign and Method of the War. <hi>When he went to reply,</hi> he falter'd and was plainly baffl'd: I then ask'd him, what made him ſo unreſolved in that Expedition, which he had ſo long provided for? I told him I knew well enough, he had ſent before his Arms, his Rods and Axes, his Trumpets, his Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Enſigns, and that Silver Eagle, to which, he had a his Houſe, a Chappel of Villany conſecrated. Yet I have baniſh'd him, who has thus begun a War! Is it likely that <hi>Manlius,</hi> the Centurion, who is already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in the <hi>Feſulane</hi> Countrey, ſhould proclaim
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103391:50"/> War, againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> in his own Name? And ſo that Camp has no manner of expectations in <hi>Catiline?</hi> He (poor Man) is driven into Exile, withdrawn not to theſe Forces (as 'tis ſaid) but to <hi>an obſcure retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at</hi> Marſeilles.</p>
                     <p n="7">7.A miſerable Province it is, not only to govern, but even to preſerve the Common-wealth. Now, if it had ſo happen'd that <hi>L. Catiline,</hi> circumvented and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by my Councils, Labours, hazards, ſhould in a ſudden fright have chang'd his reſolution, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted his Party, caſt away the Thoughts of War, quitted his intentions of Treaſon and Rebellion, beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf to Flight and Exile: It would not have been ſaid, that he was by me diſarm'd of his impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he was ſtunn'd and terrified by my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that he was driven from his hopes and deſigns; but that an uncondemn'd innocent Perſon was by the Conſul, his power and threats, forc'd into baniſhment: And there are thoſe, who (if he had done ſo) would have eſteem'd him not miſchievous, but unfortunate; and me not a moſt vigilant Conſul, but a moſt cruel Tyrant. Yet 'tis worth the while, <hi>O Quirites,</hi> to bear the tempeſt of this falſe and unjuſt envy whilſt I may ſhelter you from the danger of this dreadful and bloody War. Let it be ſaid, he was caſt out by me: may it but be true that he is gone into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But, I am certain, you will not find it ſo. I'le aſſure you, I'le never deſire the Immortal God's, that <hi>L. Catiline</hi> may lead an Army of Rebells, and you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Intelligence of his braving it in the Head of them, whereby the Envy, I have contracted, may be appeas'd: But within three Days you will know it too well. And then I fear, it will be more invidiouſly cenſur'd, that I let him go, than that I caſt him out. Such men, as becauſe he is withdrawn, cry out, he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103391:51"/> is baniſht; what would they have ſaid, if he had been executed? Though, I muſt ſay, thoſe that make ſuch a clamour of his retiring to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> fear nothing more, than that it ſhould be ſo: There is none of theſe commiſerating Creatures, but had much rather he ſhould be gone to <hi>Manlius</hi> than the <hi>Maſſilians.</hi> And I know him ſo well, that had he not been at all engaged in the preſent deſigns, his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius inclines him to die, rather in a Rebellion than an Exile. However ſince nothing has happen'd to him, beſides what proceeded from his own intentions and reſolutions (I muſt except that he went away and left us alive at <hi>Rome</hi>) Let us rather wiſh it true, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that he is gone into baniſhment.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But why do we inſiſt ſo long upon one Enemy? an Enemy that is now confeſſedly ſo: and whom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as I have ever wiſhed, the City Walls do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, I no longer fear. But why do we ſay nothing of thoſe that are left in Maſquerade at <hi>Rome,</hi> and are amongſt us? Whom I (if by any means poſſible I could) would endeavour not to be reveng'd of, but to reſtore: And why they may not be reſtor'd to the Common-wealth if they would take my advice I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand: I will tell you, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> of what ſort of men they conſiſt, then as well as I am able I will afford to each of them the remedy of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and counſel. One ſort is of thoſe who are much in Debt, but of great Eſtates, and are ſo poſſeſſed with the love of them, that they will by no means ſell any part of them: Theſe I look upon as the moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, for they are indeed Rich, but their reſolutions and humour, are moſt inexcuſable. You are poſſeſt of Lands, Houſes, Goods, Chattels, and every thing elſe about you, and you cannot perſuade your ſelves to diminiſh your poſſeſſions, to augment your Credit.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103391:51"/> Well, what do you expect? a War? What then? do you think that in a common ruine your poſſeſſions will be ſo Sacred, as not to be touched? do you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Propoſals for cancelling old Debts? They are much miſtaken that expect this from <hi>Catiline.</hi> You ſhall have new Propoſals, by my advice, but ſuch as muſt put you upon Selling, nor is there any other way poſſible, that thoſe who have Eſtates ſhould quietly enjoy them. Which if they would have done ſooner, nor have (as is moſt vain) continued ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with incumbrances upon their Farms, we might have enjoyed them, much better and much richer Citizens. But I think theſe men are leaſt of all to be dreaded, becauſe they may either be won over from their intentions, or if they will perſiſt in them, ſeem more likely to put up Prayers, than to bear Arms againſt the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. There is another ſort of thoſe who are oppreſſed with Debt and yet deſire to Rule, would have the Government in their hands, think thoſe Honours which they cannot enjoy in a quiet ſtate, would in the troubles of it fall into their Laps. To theſe this ſeems adviſable, which I offer to all the reſt, that they would deſpair for ever obtaining what they labour for: Firſt, let them know that I ever watch, am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and provide for the Common-wealth; then, that there is a great courage in all good men; a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, a vaſt multitude, and mighty Military Forces: Laſt of all, that the Immortal Gods, are ever ready to help this invincible People, this moſt renowned Empire, this moſt famous City, againſt all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Wickedneſs. But if they had accompliſh'd what with the greateſt madneſs they deſire, can they hope in the Aſhes of the City, and the Blood of the Citizens, (which with impious and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103391:52"/> cruel Affections they thirſt after that they ſhall be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, or Dictators, or Kings? Do they not ſee, they deſire that which, if obtain'd, muſt neceſſarily give the reward to ſome Vagabond or Gladiator? The third ſort is of thoſe whoſe Age is almoſt ſpent, yet ſtrong in Experience, of whom is <hi>Manlius,</hi> to whom <hi>Catiline</hi> now ſucceeds. Theſe men are of thoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies which <hi>Sulla</hi> planted at <hi>Faeſulae,</hi> which I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to have been of the beſt Citizens, and moſt Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men, but ſuch who exalted with ſudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Riches, have lived ſumptuouſly and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly. They build as if they ſhould be ever happy, and whilſt they delight themſelves with their Mannors, their Coaches, their great Retinues, their ſplendid Feaſts, they fall into ſuch Debts, as if ever they would get out of, <hi>Sulla</hi> muſt be raiſed from the Dead. Theſe have drawn ſome other Countrey, mean, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Fellows into the ſame hopes of their old Rapines. Both of which, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> I reckon as Robbers, and Plunderers, but I admoniſh them to leave off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mad, and fancying Sequeſtrations, and Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. For the ſcars of thoſe times are ſo deeply imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Citizens, that not only Men, but even Beaſts would be unwilling to undergo them again.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The fourth ſort is very various, mixt, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, who have been a great while ſunk, and will never riſe, who partly by their ſloth, partly by their imprudence, partly by their expenſiveneſs, ſtagger in their old Debts. Who being wearied out, with Suits, Judgments, Proſecutions driven out of the City, and Countrey, are retired into that Rendezvouz. Whom I do not look ſo much upon, to be bold Souldiers as Idle Cheats. If theſe cannot ſtand, e'ne let them fall, but ſo fall, that neither the City, nor even their next Neigbours, feel them. But I do not underſtand this,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103391:52"/> why if they cannot live honeſtly, they muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to periſh ſo baſely, or why they ſhould think it a leſs trouble to deſtroy ſo many with them than to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh alone. The fifth ſort is of Traytors, Aſſaſſines, and of all the moſt villanous whom I do not recall from <hi>Catiline,</hi> nor indeed can they ever be parted from him; but let them periſh in the Treaſon, for they are too many for a Priſon to ſecure. The laſt ſort is not only of <hi>Catiline</hi>'s number, but his own way and courſe of Life, his proper choice, whom he huggs, whom he lays in his Boſom; theſe you may ſee well Combed and Powdered, either with no Beard, or a very neat one, clothed in their wide long Coats, with Mantles, not Gowns, the induſtry of whoſe life, and labourious watchfulneſs, is intirely ſpent in the Revels of the Night. In theſe Clubs are converſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the Gameſters, the Pimps, the Adulterers, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt; theſe fine jolly Lads have learned, not only to make love, and receive it, to Sing, and Dance, but to Stab and Poiſon; now unleſs theſe be driven out, and deſtroyed, although <hi>Catiline</hi> did periſh, yet know there would remain a <hi>Catilinarian</hi> Seminary in the Commonwealth. But what would thoſe Wretches do? would they carry their Wenches along with them into the Tents? or can they be without them theſe long cold Nights? How will they be able to endure the <hi>Appenines,</hi> the Froſt and Snow there: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perhaps they fancy they ſhall be better able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Winter, becauſe they have learned to Dance Naked in their Banquets.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. A War ſure much to be dreaded, when <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> hath with him ſuch a Praetorian Troop of Drabs. Now <hi>Quirites</hi> rank the Guards, and Armies, againſt theſe ſuch famous Forces of <hi>Catiline:</hi> Firſt, to the Gladiator himſelf baffled and broken oppoſe your
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103391:53"/> Conſuls and Commanders: Then, againſt that feeble and refuſe handful of undone Wretches, draw forth the Flower and Strength of all <hi>Italy.</hi> Our Colonies, and free Towns ſhall be ſet againſt the rude and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Garriſons of <hi>Catiline.</hi> Nor is it neceſſary that I ſhould compare the reſt of our Forces, Ammunition, Proviſion, with the Wants and Neceſſities of that Rebel. But if all theſe things were omitted which we are ſupplied with, and he wants; ſet aſide the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights and People, the City, the Treaſury, the Cuſtoms, all <hi>Italy,</hi> all the Provinces, and Forreign Nations, if, I ſay, all theſe were omitted, let us but compare the cauſes together and ſo engage; from thence alone we may be aſſured how miſerably they muſt fall. For on our ſide Juſtice fights, on theirs, Peeviſhneſs; on ours Chaſtity, on theirs Debauchery; on ours Fidelity, on theirs Fraud; on ours Piety, on theirs Wickedneſs; on ours Conſtancy, on theirs Raſhneſs; on ours Honour, on theirs Baſeneſs; on ours Continence, on theirs Luſt; in a word Equity, Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, all the Virtues contend with Injury, Luxury, Sloth, Rage, and all the Vices: Laſtly, Plenty with Wants, good Reaſon with depraved, a ſound Mind with Madneſs, a well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hope, with a moſt improbable Preſumption. Now in ſuch an engagement and conflict as this, would not (if the endeavours of men were wanting) the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Gods themſelves force, ſo many and ſo great Vices, to ſubmit to ſuch excellent Virtues.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Since things are ſo, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> go as I ſaid before, keep Watch and Ward in your own Houſes, I have taken ſufficient care, and provided that the City ſhall be guarded without your Riſing or any Tumult. The Countrey and Towns about ſhall quickly know of <hi>Catiline</hi>'s excurſion laſt Night,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103391:53"/> and put themſelves into a poſture of defence; the Gladiators, (a great part of whom he thought aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to himſelf) have not only better reſolutions then many <hi>Patricians,</hi> but are beſides all ſafe within our power. <hi>Q.

And if thoſe Days in which we are preſerved, are no leſs memorable, and happy, to us, than thoſe in which we were Born; ſince the condition into which we are Born is uncertain, but a preſent deliverance is matter of certain joy; ſince we are Born inapprehenſive, but when, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved are able to recount the Pleaſures of our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And if with thankfulneſs and glory, we placed <hi>Romulus</hi> the Founder of this City among the Immortal Gods; then ſurely he who ſaved this ſame City ſo built, ſo augmented, ſo beautified deſerves to be had in Honour with you and your Poſterity. For we have reſtrained thoſe Flames which were juſt kindling, and ſurrounding the Temples, the Shrines, the Houſes, and Walls of the whole City; we have repelled thoſe Swords that were drawn upon the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103391:66"/> Common-wealth, we have put by their points from your Throats. Which having been diſcovered, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and proved by me in the Senate, I will now briefly recount to you alſo, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> that thoſe of you who are not yet acquainted therewith, but are in expectation, may apprehend how great and manifeſt they are, by what means they were found out and obtained by us. Firſt, Since <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> a few Days ago hurried out of the City, and left the Aſſociates of his Villany, the fierce Captains of this horrid War at <hi>Rome,</hi> I continually watch'd and provided, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> that we might be ſafe amidſt ſo great and hidden treacheries.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For when I caſt <hi>Catiline</hi> out of the City (a word of envy I am not now afraid of, I rather fear the letting him have gone alive) then, when I ſought to root him out, I was confident either the whole Band of Conſpirators would go along with him, or thoſe that tarried behind muſt without him be impotent and ineffective; and when I ſaw many, whom I knew inflamed with the greateſt rage and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, ſtill left among us at <hi>Rome;</hi> I ſo ſpent all my Days, and Nights, as I might beſt pry into both what they did and deſigned: That ſince the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble greatneſs of this Treaſon, muſt needs diminiſh the credit of my Oration, I might ſo poſſeſs my ſelf of the Affair, as not to put you upon providing for your ſafety, till with your own Eyes, you beheld the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive danger. Therefore, ſo ſoon as I found the <hi>Allobrogian</hi> Ambaſſadors were Solicited by <hi>P. Lentulus,</hi> to ſtir up a <hi>Tranſalpine</hi> War, and a <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Sedition; that they were ſent to their own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and in the ſame Journey were to deliver Letters, and inſtructions to <hi>Catiline;</hi> that <hi>Titus Vulturtius</hi> was joined Agent with them, and to him
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103391:67"/> were the Letters to <hi>Catiline</hi> committed; I reckoned I had got the greateſt opportunity, to compaſs that which ſeemed moſt difficult, and which above all I ever begg'd of the Immortal Gods: that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy might not only be made manifeſt to me, but to the Senate and you. To this purpoſe I yeſterday ſent for to me <hi>L. Flaccus,</hi> and <hi>C. Pomptinus,</hi> valiant Praetors, and great lovers of the Common-wealth; I told them the whole Affair, and ſhewed them what I would have done. They, (whoſe deſigns were ever generous, and advantageous for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick) without any ſcruple, or delay, undertook the buſineſs, and ſo ſoon as it began to be dark, went privately to the <hi>Milvian</hi> Bridge; ſo poſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in two Parties about the Neighbouring Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that <hi>Tiber</hi> and the Bridge were between them, Thither alſo, without any ſuſpicion, they drew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Valiant men; and ſeveral choice young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men taken out of the <hi>Reatine</hi> praefecture, (whoſe aſſiſtance I continually make uſe of in preſerving the Common-wealth,) I ſent thither with their Swords. As the third Watch of the Night was almoſt expired, the <hi>Allobrogian</hi> Ambaſſadours with a great retinue, and <hi>T. Vulturcius</hi> with them, began to enter upon the Bridge; an on ſet was made upon them, and Swords drawn on both ſides; the two Praetors only knew the deſign, the reſt acted meerly upon their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then <hi>Pomptinus,</hi> and <hi>Flaccus</hi> coming in, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently appeaſed the fight; all Letters whatſoever were delivered as ſealed to the Praetors; and every one of them that were taken, brought before me about break of Day. Preſently I ſent for that <hi>Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brian Gabinius,</hi> the impious contriver of all theſe Villanies (while he ſuſpected nothing) to appear
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103391:67"/> before me. Then I call'd for <hi>P. Statilius,</hi> and after him <hi>C. Cethegus:</hi> but laſt of all, and much indiſpoſed came <hi>Lentulus;</hi> I believe he had ſat up very late the Night before, to write Letters more than ordinary. In the Morning there came to me the greateſt and moſt eminent Perſons of the City, who hearing the news were mightily of the Opinion that I ſhould open the Letters before I brought them into the Senate; leſt they not anſwering expectation I ſhould ſeem to have raiſed too great an hurry in the City: But I was poſitive, not to do any thing in ſuch a publick danger, without referring it to the publick Council. For in my Opinion, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> if thoſe things which had been diſcovered to me, had not been found out, yet I think in ſo great dangers of the Common-wealth, I could not fear the uſing of too much diligence. I preſently ſummoned (as you all know) a full Senate: And in the mean time, by the advice of the <hi>Allobrogians,</hi> I ſent <hi>C. Sulpicius</hi> a Praetor, and very truſty, to ſearch the Houſe of <hi>C. Cethegus</hi> for Arms, and to bring with him, what he found there: From whence he hath now brought me a very great number of Daggers, and Swords.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I introduced <hi>T. Vulturtius</hi> without the <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes,</hi> and by command of the Senate, promiſed him the publick Faith: exhorting him without any fear to ſpeak plainly what he knew. At length, when he had recovered himſelf out of a pannick fear, he confeſſed he was ſent by <hi>P. Lentulus</hi> with Letters, and inſtructions to <hi>Catiline,</hi> to adviſe him that he would uſe even all the ſervile aſſiſtance he could get, and as ſoon as poſſible draw towards the City with an Army. And with this deſign, that ſo ſoon as they had fired every part of it, as it had been divided and diſtributed among them; ſo ſoon as they had
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103391:68"/> accompliſhed their Maſſacre of the Citizens, he might be at hand to ſnap thoſe that fled, and then join himſelf with theſe City-Captains. Then were the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Embaſſadours introduced, who declared, that they had an Oath adminiſtred to them, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>P. Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius,</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to their Countrey; that they were directed by <hi>L. Caſſius</hi> to bring their Horſe as ſoon as they could into <hi>Italy,</hi> and not to be too ſlow with their Foot Forces: That <hi>Lentulus</hi> did very much aſſure himſelf our of the <hi>Sybilline</hi> Prophecies and Divinations of the Augurs, he ſhould be the Third <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who muſt needs come to the Government of this City and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the two before him having been <hi>Cinna,</hi> and <hi>Sylla;</hi> that this Year muſt be fatal to the City and Empire, as being the Tenth ſince the Virgins abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, the Twentieth ſince the burning of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol: But this they ſaid was the only diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cethegus,</hi> and the reſt, they would have the Maſſacre, and firing of the City to be upon the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnalia; Cethegus</hi> thought that too long a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Not to be tedious, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> we commanded the Letters to be produced, as they were ſaid to have been delivered to them, by any Perſon; Firſt, We ſhewed <hi>Cethegus</hi> his Seal, he acknowledged it; then we broke it open, and read it written in his own hand, that he would perform to the Senate, and People of the <hi>Allobroges</hi> whatſoever he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to their Ambaſſadours; and pray'd them to obſerve thoſe inſtructions their Ambaſſadours now brought them. Then <hi>Cethegus</hi> who a little before had made ſome evaſions to thoſe Swords and Daggers that were taken in his Houſe, ſaying, That he was ever a lover of good Arms; upon reading the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103391:68"/> was ſo ſtrangely dejected and amazed that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd by Conſcience he ſpake not a word more: <hi>Statilius</hi> being brought in, acknowledged both his Hand and Seal: then were his Lettets read of the ſame import with the former, which without more ado he confeſſed. Then I ſhewed <hi>Lentulus</hi> his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and asked him whether he would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Seal, which he did: I told him 'twas very well known, the Effigies of his Grandfather, an eminent Perſon one who moſt entirely lov'd his Countrey and his fellow Citizens; I told him the very ſilent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance thereof, might have been ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call him from ſuch a villanous enterprize. The Letters alſo to the Senate, and People of the <hi>Allobroges</hi> were read, and I gave him liberty to ſpeak if he had any thing in relation to them: At firſt he denied all, then the whole Evidence being given and opened, he roſe up, and ask'd the <hi>Gallicanes,</hi> what he ever had to do with them, or to what purpoſe they ſhould ever come to his Houſe: The ſame he alſo demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Vulturtius.</hi> They anſwered with brevity, and conſtancy, who it was that brought them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and how often they had been there; and they asked him, whether he had never ſpoken to them of the <hi>Sybilline</hi> Oracle; But then immediately confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Treaſon (ſuch is the power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience!) he declared, 'twas ſo. He might have denied the whole, but to the amazement of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he made a ſurprizing confeſſion. Thus not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Wit and Eloquence for which he was always ſo eminent, failed him; but ſuch was the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his diſcovered and expoſed Treaſon, that his very impudence and equivocation, wherein he had no equal, were at an utter loſs. <hi>Vulturtius</hi> then preſently demanded that the <hi>Letters</hi> which were
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103391:69"/> given to him from <hi>Lentulus</hi> to <hi>Catiline,</hi> might be produced and opened: At which <hi>Lentulus,</hi> was in an extream diſturbance, yet he acknowledged his Hand and Seal: They had no Name to them, but the words were theſe, <hi>Who I am you will know by him whom I have ſent to you, conſider well in what neceſſity you are, and remember to be valiant: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the Eſtate of your Affairs requires; ask aid of all even the meaneſt.—Gabinius</hi> being then brought in began to anſwer with a great deal of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence but at laſt denied nothing of what the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanes</hi> had accuſed him. And though O <hi>Quirites,</hi> the Letters, the Hands, and Seals, laſtly every Mans own confeſſion ſeemed to me undeniable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and Evidences of the Treaſon; yet their Colours, their Eyes, their Countenances, their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, gave me much greater Aſſurance of their Guilt. So were they amazed, ſo did they look down, ſo did they ſometimes ſteal a look from one another that they ſeemed, not to have been diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by others but by themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Evidences being thus given and opened, I did then, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> ask the Senate what was beſt to be done, for preſervation of the Common-wealth. Many brave and important Propoſals were offered by the principal Members, which the Senate very una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly followed. And becauſe in our Memory, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> the Votes have not been enrolled, I will give you an account what was the ſenſe of the Houſe. Firſt, Thanks were given me in the largeſt expreſſions, for that by my Virtue, Counſel, and Care, the Common-wealth had been delivered from the greateſt dangers. Then were <hi>L. Flaccus,</hi> and <hi>C. Pomptinus</hi> the Praetors, whoſe faithful and valiant aſſiſtance I made uſe of moſt deſervedly honoured.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103391:69"/> And alſo that excellent Perſon my Collegue, had thanks imparted to him, for removing from his own and the publick Counſels, all the Abettors of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy. Then it was reſolved that <hi>P. Lentulus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Praetorſhip, ſhould be committed. That <hi>C. Cethegus, L. Statilius, P. Gabinius,</hi> who were all preſent, ſhould be alſo committed. The ſame Decree paſſed againſt <hi>L. Caſſius,</hi> who took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf the management of burning the City; againſt <hi>M. Caeparius,</hi> to whom, as it was diſcovered, <hi>Apulia</hi> was aſſign'd, that he might raiſe the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds of that Countrey: Againſt <hi>P. Furius,</hi> a principal Perſon of thoſe Colonies which <hi>L. Sulla</hi> planted at <hi>Faeſulae:</hi> Againſt Q. <hi>Manlius Chilo,</hi> who all along aſſiſted <hi>Furius</hi> in ſoliciting the <hi>Allobrogians:</hi> Againſt <hi>P. Umbrenus</hi> a Freeman, by whom as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, thoſe <hi>Gallicanes</hi> were firſt brought to <hi>Gabinius.</hi> And the Senate uſed ſuch moderation, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> that out of ſo great a Conſpiracy, ſo great an Intereſt, ſo great a Multitude of Domeſtick Enemies, only by the puniſhment of Nine moſt profligate Wretches, it was their Opinion the Commonwealth might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the Minds of all the reſt that were diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted reſtored to a temper. There was alſo, <hi>O Quirites,</hi> a publick Thankſgiving to the Immortal Gods for their eſpecial goodneſs to us, decreed in my Name; which no Gown-man ever yet obtained ſince this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was built; the Words of the Decree were theſe: <hi>That I had delivered the City from burning, the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens from Maſſacre,</hi> Italy <hi>from War.</hi> Which Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> compared with others, hath this difference; they were appointed for a good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Commonwealth, this alone for its preſervation. That which was firſt requiſite to be done was accordingly tranſacted; For <hi>P. Lentulus</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:103391:70"/> convict by the Evidence, by his own confeſſion, by the judgment of the Senate, did not only loſe the right of a Praetor, but of a Citizen, and laid down his Magiſtracy: That (though reſpect to the Authority, did not reſtrain the renowned. <hi>C. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> from killing <hi>C. Glaucias</hi> Praetor, of whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was by Name decreed) we might be delivered even from the Religious awe of that, by now pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing <hi>P. Lentulus</hi> as a private Perſon.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Now, <hi>Quirites,</hi> theſe impious Leaders of the moſt horrid and dangerous War are taken and comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you may conclude, that all the Forces of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline,</hi> all his hopes, all his ſtrength are ruined in the ſuppreſſion of theſe. Whom when I had driven out of the City, I foreſaw ſo far gone, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> that neither the drowſineſs of <hi>P. Lentulus,</hi> nor the fat of <hi>L. Caſſius,</hi> nor the furious raſhneſs of <hi>Cethegus,</hi> was any more to be dreaded. He alone was to be feared, and that only ſo long as he was harboured within the City Walls. Then, he knew every thing, had acceſs to every Man; then, could, and dared ſend about, ſolicit, ſuborn: He had advice for every enterpriſe, nor was his Tongue, or his Hand wanting to the Execution of his Counſels. Now he hath ſome men choſen, and appointed for accompliſhing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; but he was wont never to think any thing done when he had given Orders for it, there was no thing but what he himſelf would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, he would ſet upon it, watch over it, labour in it; he could bear Cold, and Thirſt, and Hunger. And therefore this Man, ſo eager, ſo provided, ſo bold, ſo cunning, ſo watchful in villany, ſo active in Treaſon, if I had not driven him out of his Domeſtick lurkings, into his Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz of Rogues abroad (I tell you truly, O <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:103391:70"/> what I think) I could not eaſily have lifted this vaſt burden of miſchief off your Necks. If he had been here, he would never have appointed the <hi>Saturnalia</hi> for you, nor would he have ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the deſtruction and fatal Day to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; nor would he ever have committed ſuch an over-ſight, that his Seal, and his Letters ſhould be produced as Evidences of his manifeſt Treaſon. Which now in his abſence are ſo managed that there never was any Robbery of a private Houſe ſo plainly found out, as this Conſpiracy againſt the Common-wealth is evidently detected and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. But, if <hi>Catiline</hi> had continued in the City to this Day, though I had as much as poſſible, met and reſiſted his deſigns; yet, to ſpeak the leaſt, we muſt have engaged with him; nor could we ever whilſt he continued an Enemy in the City have freed the Common-wealth from ſo great hazards with ſuch Peace, ſuch Quiet, ſuch Silence.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Though I muſt confeſs, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> all theſe things were ſo managed by me, that they ſeem to have been both laid and performed by the direction and counſel of the Immortal Gods. This we may very well conclude of, becauſe humane Counſels can hardly ſeem to ſway ſo great Tranſactions; then, at each nick of time they afforded ſuch preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and aſſiſtance that we have had almoſt an ocular demonſtration of them. For if I ſhould paſs over thoſe blazing Stars ſeen in the Weſt, the Heavens burning, the Thunderbolts, the Earthquakes, and many other ſuch things, which in the time of our Conſulſhip have been ſo numerous, that the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Gods ſeem themſelves to have proclaimed what hath now been done. Yet this, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> which I am now about to ſay, muſt by no means he paſs'd
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103391:71"/> over or left out. You cannot but remember that when <hi>Cotta</hi> and <hi>Torquatus</hi> were Conſuls, a great deal of the Capitol was deſtroyed by Lightning, the Images of the Immortal Gods beaten down, the Statues of our Anceſtors broken, the Braſs upon which our Laws were Engraven, melted: And particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Romulus</hi> the Founder of this City was ſtruck; there (as you know,) he lay, a golden Infant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and gaping after the Teats of the Wolf. At which time the Augurs flock't together out of all <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truria,</hi> and declared that there were Maſſacres and Fires, Everſion of Laws, Civil and Domeſtick Wars, deſtruction of the whole City, and Empire, approaching; unleſs the Immortal Gods being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed ſhould through their Divinity change as it were the very courſe of Fate. By their advice a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile was held for Ten Days, nor was any thing omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which appertain'd to mitigate the diſpleaſure of the Gods: 'Twas alſo by the ſame Perſons enjoin'd, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould have a greater Image, placed on high and (contrary to what formerly it was) the Face turned towards the Eaſt: And ſo they gave us hopes, if that Image (which you behold,) look't toward the riſing of the Sun, the <hi>Forum,</hi> and the <hi>Curia;</hi> then would all the Counſels, which were privately entered upon, againſt the ſafety of this City, and Empire, be ſo detected that the Senate and whole <hi>Roman</hi> People might ſee thoroughly into them. And thus thoſe Conſuls Decreed it to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: But ſo ſlowly was it carried on, that neither by the former Conſuls, nor by us hath it been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed before this Day.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Here, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> who can be ſo averſe from Truth, ſo mad, ſo ſtupid, as to deny all theſe things which we ſee, eſpecially, this City to be managed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103391:71"/> by the direction and power of the Immortal Gods? For when it was then interpreted, that there was a Maſſacre, a Fire, an over-throw of the Common-wealth preparing, and all by miſchievous Citizens, which yet for the greatneſs of the Villanies ſeem'd incredible, you now find that ſuch things were not only intended but attempted. Did it not fall out juſt ſo as to appear to be effected by the Providence of the beſt, and greateſt <hi>Jove;</hi> that when yeſterday Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Conſpirators, and their diſcoverers were by my order led through the <hi>Forum,</hi> at that very time, the Statue ſhould be erected? Which by its ſituation being turned towards you and the Senate, the Senate and you have now beheld, all thoſe things that were contrived againſt the ſafety of the Common-wealth, clear'd, and proved. Of how much greater hatred then, and puniſhment are they worthy, who have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to throw their impious Fires not only into your Houſes, and Lodgings, but into the Shrines and Temples of the Gods: Which if I ſhould ſay I had reſtrained it would be intolerable preſumption. 'Twas he, 'twas <hi>Jupiter</hi> that withſtood them: He ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Capitol, theſe Temples, this City; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved you all. From the Immortal Gods, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> I received my underſtanding, my will, by them was I led to theſe ſo great diſcoveries. And for the ſolicitation of the <hi>Allobrogians,</hi> by <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus,</hi> and the reſt of our domeſtick Enemies, ſo great an Affair had never been truſted to Perſons ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and forraign, thoſe Letters had certainly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been Committed to them, unleſs by the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Gods, they had been infatuated and all Counſel ſnatch'd away from ſo bold an enterpriſe. Then that the <hi>Gallicane</hi> People of a diſcontented City, the only remaining People that ſeem able to make War
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103391:72"/> upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> and yet not do it; that theſe ſhould neglect the hopes of Empire, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantages proferr'd to them even by <hi>Patricians,</hi> and prefer your ſafety before their own profit: Do you think that this was not eminently the Divine work? Eſpecially when they needed not have uſed force, but only have kept ſilence and overcome us.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Wherefore, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> ſince Prayers are decreed at every Altar, go, and celebrate theſe Days with your Wives and Children; many Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours juſt and due have been given to the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Gods, but more juſt than theſe were never any: For, ſnatcht from the moſt cruel, and miſerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, (and ſnatcht you were, without Slaughter, without Blood, without an Army, without the leaſt Affray, (in your Gowns have you overcome under the conduct and command of one Gownman. Now do but call to mind, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> thoſe Seditions, not only which you have heard of, but thoſe which you your ſelves remember, and have ſeen; <hi>L. Sulla</hi> ſuppreſt <hi>P. Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picius;</hi> caſt <hi>C. Marius</hi> Keeper of the City out of it: And of many other brave men, ſome he baniſh'd, ſome he put to death. <hi>Cn. Octavius</hi> the Conſul, by force of Arms drave his own Colleague out of the City. Then was this place heaped with the Bodies, and flowing with the Blood of the Citizens. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Cinna</hi> with <hi>Marius</hi> overcame, and then ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Eminent men were ſlain, that the Lights of the City ſeem'd extinguiſh'd. At length <hi>Sylla</hi> reveng'd the cruelty of this Victory. But there is no need to tell you with what deſtruction of Citizens, with how great Calamity to the whole Common-wealth, <hi>M. Lepidus</hi> oppoſed that moſt worthy and brave Man, <hi>Q. Catulus;</hi> but his fall gave not ſuch occaſion to the Common-wealth to mourn, as it did to thoſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103391:72"/> Perſons that were concerned with him. Such as theſe, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> were the ſormer Seditions; yet were they not deſign'd for ſubverſion, but only for alteration of the Government: They did not deſire to have no Common-wealth, but only to be chief in that which was; they did not wiſh to burn down the City, but only to be advanced in it; yet all theſe Seditions, (none of which aimed at the deſtruction of the Common-wealth,) were at laſt determined, not by a peaceful Reconciliation but by a Bloody Slaughter of the Citizens. This one, alone, ſince the Memory of Man, the greateſt and moſt cruel War, ſuch a War as the worſt Salvages never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted upon their own People, in which was the Law made by <hi>Lentulus, Catiline, Caſſius, Cethegus,</hi> that all thoſe who were ſafe, while the City was ſafe, ſhould be accounted among the number of Enemies: I have ſo managed Affairs, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> that you are all preſerved in ſafety, that when your Enemies intended there ſhould be no more Citizens left than a boundleſs Maſſacre could not devour, ſo much only of the City as the Flames could not conſume, I have kept both the City and the Citizens, entire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. For all which eminent Service, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> I ask of you no reward of Virtue, no Enſign of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, no Monument of Praiſe, but only the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Memory of this Day. I would have all my Triumphs, all Ornaments of Honour, all Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Glory, all Enſigns of Praiſe, to be placed and treaſured up in your affections, None of thoſe dumb ſhews and pictur'd Honours which the leſs worthy can attain, delight me: Our Affairs are che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in your Memory, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> they grow by your Diſcourſes, they ſhall be ſtrengthened and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103391:73"/> by the Monuments of Hiſtory: That Day I mean, which I hope will be eternally Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, which was created for the preſervation of of this City, and Glory of my Conſulſhip. When at the ſame time, there were two Citizens in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, one of which terminated the Bounds of your Empire, not by the extent of Earth, but the Regions of Heaven; the other ſaved the Houſe and Seat of the ſame Empire.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. But becauſe the ſtate and condition of thoſe Affairs I have managed, make my Circumſtances very different from thoſe Perſons who wage the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Wars; for I muſt live among thoſe I have conquered and ſubdued; they either deſtroy their Enemies or quit them, when reduced; it lies upon you, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> to provide that if their good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons advantage them, mine may not prejudice me. I have taken care that the impious and cruel deſigns of theſe moſt audacious Men have done you no hurt, now you muſt take care that they hurt not me. Though for my own part, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> I can not be much hurt by them; there is the greateſt Guard in good men, whom I am now for ever aſſured of: There is a great reverence to the Common-wealth, which will always, even when ſilent, defend me: There is a great power of Conſcience, which, when thoſe that neglect it, would deſtroy me, ſhall make them betray themſelves. There is alſo ſuch a reſolved mind in you, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> that we ſhall not only not give place to any Mans audaciouſneſs, but we ſhall ever freely provoke all the baſe and villanous. What if all the rage of our domeſtick Enemies was remov'd from you, and turned upon me alone? Then muſt you provide, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> as conſidering in what condition you would hereafter have thoſe to be, who
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103391:73"/> for your ſakes have offered up themſelves to envy and all hazards. What more is there that I can add to the enjoyments of my life eſpecially ſince as to the Honour and the Praiſe of Virtue, I can ſee nothing higher to which I may aſcend? This only would I aim at, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> that what I have done in my Conſulſhip I may, when a private Perſon, defend and adorn: That if there be any envy to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd for preſerving the Common-wealth, it may hurt the envious, and turn to my glory. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I will ever ſo behave my ſelf in the Common-wealth, as always remembring what I have already performed and that ſo agreeably, that it may appear all my performances have been directed by Virtue, not by chance. And now, O <hi>Quirites,</hi> becauſe the Night approaches, worſhip <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Keeper of this City, and of you: Depart to your own Houſes, and (although the danger ſeems to be over) yet with the ſame guard and watchfulneſs defend them, as you did the Night before. That you may not long be put to this trouble, but that you may be eſtabliſhed in perpetual Peace, ſhall be my care.</p>

When you act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dictates of the underſtanding the effects thereof will be agreeable, if affection poſſeſſeth you, that tyrannizeth and the Mind becomes uſeleſs under the oppreſſion. I could offer you, O Conſcript Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, many preſidents of Kingdoms and Nations which have been ruined by the reſults of Paſſion, but I had rather produce the examples of our Anceſtors, who by decreeing what became themſelves, more than what their Enemies deſerved, reduced them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a well compoſed and laſting Obedience; in that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103391:80"/> 
                        <hi>Macedonian</hi> War which we waged with King <hi>Perſes,</hi> the great and rich City of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> (grown ſo by the favour of the <hi>Roman</hi> People) became perfidious and adverſe to our Intereſts; yet when the War was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and a Conſultation held what ſhould be done with thoſe <hi>Rhodians,</hi> our Anceſtors diſmiſſed them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, that none might afterwards ſay the War was begun rather to enrich our ſelves then to repel injuries in all the <hi>Punick</hi> Wars, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> would often in times of Truce and Ceſſation of Arms, practice the baſeſt Villanies againſt us, but we never took the opportunites of like requitals: We ever more tenderly regarded the demands of Honour than the exactions of Juſtice. This is that, O Conſcript Fathers, which I would have you conſult in the preſent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of <hi>Lentulus</hi> and the reſt, what will be moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your Reputation and Government rather then to your indignation. If indeed a puniſhment be requiſite which bears a juſt proportion to their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we muſt find out ſome thing new, but if that exceeds all humane Invention, then let us be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to follow the moſt uſual Methods of Law.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that ſpake before me have excellently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerated the Common-wealth, have conſidered the cruelty of War, have recounted the miſeries of the conquered: The raviſhing of Virgins, the haling Children from the Embraces of their Parents, the Matrons expoſed to the Victors fury; Temples, and Houſes demoliſhed; Fire and Sword raging; in a word, every place filled with Blood and Confuſion, with the heaps of the dead and the groans of the dying.</p>
                     <p>But what I wonder can be the deſign of ſuch an Oration? Is it to make us more enraged at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy? This is needleſs, thoſe who have not been moved by the horrid Nature of it, will never be
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103391:80"/> ſtirred up by an Oration. No, 'tis needleſs: We want it not; no Mortal Men were ever apt to eſteem the injuries intended them too ſmall, they have often judged them greater than indeed they were.</p>
                     <p>Above all, O Conſcript Fathers, we ſhould be afraid of an exceſs of Indignation; when thoſe who live obſcurely, err in undue heats of Paſſion, but few take notice of it, their Fortune and their Fame are equals; but we who are raiſed to ſo great an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, have all Mankind for the Cenſurers of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo that the greateſt power hath the leaſt liberty to tranſgreſs its juſt bounds: We cannot honourably allow our ſelves to be partial to any, to hate any, no, nor ſo much as to be angry with any. What in others is only called Anger, in us will be Pride and Cruelty; I do indeed believe, O Conſcript Fathers, that no torments are too great for their deſerts; but People are always inclined more to remember what was laſt, and to conſider the Cruelties of puniſhment than the Merits of the Cauſe. I am certain what the excellent <hi>Silanus</hi> ſpoke was from a ſincere affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Common-wealth, that in ſo great an Affair he would not interpoſe either private love or hatred; I am well acquainted both with his worth and modeſty; but what ſhould lead him to ſuch an Opinion? Cruel I can't ſay (for what can be cruel againſt ſuch offenders?) But very different from our Polity. 'Tis idle to ſuppoſe, fear ſhould be the cauſe of it, ſince by the diligence of the moſt renowned Conſul, we are abundantly ſecur'd from dangers. As to the Nature of the puniſhment, Death is not ſo much a torment it ſelf as the end of others; it diſſoves all the Miſeries of Mortality, and beyond that is neither care nor joy. But why (let Heaven judge) was it not propoſed in the Senate
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103391:81"/> that they ſhould be firſt beaten with Rods? Was it not becauſe you know the <hi>Porcian</hi> Law forbids it? And other Laws command the Penalty of Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not that of Death, for condemned Citizens. And now, is it more grievous to be Whipt than to be put to Death? If it be then, why is not that moſt heavy and ſevere puniſhment inflicted upon Perſons guilty (as theſe are) of the higheſt Crimes? But if Whipping be the more gentle and moderate, how comes the Law to reſtrain you in that which is the leſs, if you are not to be reſtrained from that which is the utmoſt ſeverity.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, who ſhall ever blame us for ſuch a Decree againſt the manifeſt Traitors of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth? Yes, time and chance brings all things about, and every Nation is ſubject to their Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Theſe men will deſerve what they have: But conſider well, O Conſcript Fathers what you do; the worſt Preſidents have good Originals; when the Government comes into the hands of ignorant or leſs good men, this new Example will be transferred from theſe who have deſerved to die, to thoſe who have not.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lacaedemonians,</hi> upon the Conqueſt of <hi>Athens,</hi> appointed Thirty Perſons to manage the Government; at firſt theſe began to put to Death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Trial every one that was notoriouſly miſchievous and hated; the People rejoiced at this they ſaid it was very well done; after a while, that the Tyranny was grown ſtrong they were wont with the like Arbitrary Power to kill good and bad, that all might be kept in awe. Thus the City being ſlaviſhly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſuffered the ſevere rewards of its fooliſh joy.</p>
                     <p>In our Memory, when <hi>Sylla</hi> executed <hi>Damaſippus</hi> and ſome other vile Perſons, who did not rejoice and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103391:81"/> applaud it? Ill and Factious men who diſturbed the Government deſerv'd (as 'twas ſaid) to be put to death, but that was only an entrance; afterwards whoever had an Houſe or Farm, or any Goods and Chattels, which were worth coveting, was brought into the Number of the proſcribed till thoſe that rejoiced at the Death of <hi>Damaſippus,</hi> were forced to follow that fate which they ſo unwarily admired: Nor did <hi>Sylla</hi> ever leave cutting Throats, till his whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was well repleniſh'd with the ſpoil.</p>
                     <p>This I do not fear from <hi>M. Tullius,</hi> nor the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times; but in our great City we may expect variety of Succeſſors, at another time, there may be another Conſul with an Army at his command, who may think that true, which is indeed falſe: Now if he hath this example, and by Decree of the Senate the Sword be put into the Conſuls hands; who ſhall put a ſtop to him or oblige him to modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Our Anceſtors, O Conſcript Fathers, never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either Councel or Courage; nor hath Pride hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them from imitating the Cuſtoms of forreign Nations, when they were honourable and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; their Arms and Military Exerciſes they learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the <hi>Samnites;</hi> the Enſigns of Magiſtracy they took up from the <hi>Hetruſci;</hi> Laſtly, whatſoever ſeemed well either among Allies or Enemies they practiſed with the greateſt emulation at home: They were always for imitating rather then envying the good: Then alſo they followed the Cuſtoms of <hi>Greece,</hi> corrected their Citizens with Rods, puniſhed the Condemn'd with Death; but afterwards, when the Common-wealth was come to its full growth, and by the Multitude of Citizens Factions began to reign, the Innocent to be circumvented and other ſuch
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103391:82"/> miſchiefs; then were the <hi>Porcian</hi> and other Laws enacted, whereby baniſhment was granted to the Condemned.</p>
                     <p>This under favour, O Conſcript Fathers, I look upon as great Reaſon why we ſhould not aim at new Counſels; their Virtue and their Wiſdom which raiſed ſo great an Empire out of ſuch ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, are much more to be valued than ours who hardly keep what they left us.</p>
                     <p>What do I deſire then? That they ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed and augment the Forces of <hi>Catiline?</hi> No: I I would have all their Eſtates confiſcated, I would have them kept Priſoners up and down in the ſtrongeſt Free Towns of <hi>Italy;</hi> That hereafter no one intercede either to the Senate, or the People for them; whoever ſhall, let the Senate judg him an Enemy to the common ſafety.</p>

                        </note>WHen I conſider our Affairs and Dangers, O Conſcript Fathers, and weigh with them thoſe Sentences ſome have propoſed, I muſt declare my ſelf of a far different Opinion: They ſeem to have been debating the Puniſhment of thoſe who have raiſed War againſt their Countrey, and their Parents, the Houſes where they were Born, the Temples where (if they had any Religion) they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103391:83"/> were wont to adore; but after what manner? Doth not the thing it ſelf require us to conſult, how we ſhall be moſt certainly delivered from theſe men, rather then what gentle puniſhments we inflict upon them?</p>
                     <p>You may puniſh other Crimes when they are committed, this unleſs you take care to prevent, no Tribunal can ſignifie any thing; the City once taken, nothing is left to the Conquered.</p>
                     <p>Let me now (by the Immortal Gods) appeal, not to the generous Lovers of their Countrey, but even to thoſe who love their Houſes, Gardens, and Pictures better the Common-wealth; if you deſire to enjoy theſe, and a ſerene courſe of Pleaſure, rouze up your ſelves and lay hold on the ſinking Empire: We are not now about Taxes and Alliances; Life and Liberty lie at Stake.</p>
                     <p>I have very often, O Conſcript Fathers, in this place complained of the Luxury and Avarice of of our Citizens, and I have many Enemies upon that account; and if I would never for my own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, favour the Commiſſion of a Crime, I will not now pardon the Luſts of thoſe who have almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated our utter ruine. You took indeed but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle notice of my reprimands, and yet the Common-wealth ſtood; the excellency of the eſtabliſhment ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the wants of diligence and virtue: But now the Queſtion is not whether we will live vertuouſly, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, not how great and magnificent the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſhall be, but (whatever other thoughts you may) now 'tis whether we and all ours ſhall not fall into the power of the Enemy. Here ſhall any Man call moderate proceedings gentleneſs, and pity? We have long ago loſt the right uſe of words; to laviſh other mens Goods is named Liberality; a front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103391:83"/> impudence in Vice is aſſurance; to this paſs is the Common-wealth come! Well; ſince 'tis ſo, let men be eſteemed liberal with borrowed Eſtates; let them be merciful to Thieves and Rogues; but let them not be profuſe with our Blood, and whilſt they ſave a few Villains deſtroy every good Man in the City.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> hath indeed ſpoken very accurately; ſomething he ſaid of Life and Death, (as much as I can underſtand) ſuppoſing thoſe things falſe, which are related of the Infernal ſtate; that there is a different Journey and different Habitation, that the wicked are ſeparated from the good, into dark places full of diſorder, naſtineſs, and horror. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he propoſed for them only the miſeries of Life, to have their Eſtates confiſcated, and their Bodies kept in perpetual Impriſonment: Very well. But he would not have them at <hi>Rome,</hi> left the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhould be hired to reſcue them; as if they could be more ſafe in the Towns of <hi>Italy,</hi> where there is leſs power to ſecure them. So that if he be ſenſible of danger his Counſel is inſufficient, if he be not, there is the greater neceſſity that I ſhould fear both for my ſelf and you.</p>
                     <p>Be aſſured that whatſoever meaſures you take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Lentulus</hi> and the reſt, they will have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon <hi>Catilines</hi> Army and the whole Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy; if you be reſolute here, their courage will fail, if you flag they'l grow bold.</p>
                     <p>Don't think that our Anceſtors did by Arms alone raiſe this Common-wealth from ſo mean an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to its preſent greatneſs: If that had been all, ſurely we ſhould now be much more flouriſhing than ever they were; we have more Allies and Citizens, greater Forces both of Foot and Horſe, than ever
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103391:84"/> they had: But other things made them great which are loſt by us: Their government was ſupported by Induſtry at home, by Juſtice abroad; their conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were generous, free from the influence of Vice and all Affection to it; Inſtead of which we have nothing but Luxury and Avarice; the Publick is oppreſſed with Debt; private men enjoy the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt abundance; We admire Riches and follow Sloth; there is now no diſtinction obſerv'd between the good and bad, but Ambition ſeizes upon all the rewards of Virtues; nor can it be otherwiſe when every Man acts ſeparately for his own Intereſt; whileſt you are domeſtick Slaves to your Pleaſures, Riches, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; every attempt that is made will be ready to ſink ſuch an helpleſs Common-wealth; but I paſs by theſe things.</p>
                     <p>What are we now to do? The greateſt Citizens have conſpired to ruine their Countrey; they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the <hi>Gallick</hi> Nation, ever moſt fatal to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Name; their General with his Army is juſt coming upon us. And now you are at a ſtand what to do with thoſe of them whom you have apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the very Walls! Now nothing but pity, compaſſion to ſome ambitious, raſh young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have taken up Arms! Yes, let them go, armed as they are! What ſloth and ſoftneſs of mind is this? Surely ſuch Mercy it is as (if they be armed) muſt at length end in our miſery: But 'tis acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged dangerous; yet you will not fear it! Nay, though you profeſs the greateſt fears, yet with ſloth &amp; negligence you look upon one another, and expect the Divine aſſiſtance to preſerve the Common-wealth (as it hath often done) in the moſt eminent dangers: But that aſſiſtance is not to be expected by faint Wiſhes and feminine Prayers; ſucceſs is always given to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103391:84"/> ſober Councels, to vigilant and active endeavours. If you give up your ſelves to ſecurity and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, you do in vain implore the Powers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; they are angry and averſe to you.</p>
                     <p>To ſpeak of our Anceſtors; <hi>A. Manlius Torqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in the <hi>Gallick</hi> War, commanded his Son to be killed becauſe he ſought the Enemy contrary to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; thus that Noble Gentleman had Death for a reward of unſeaſonable, though Victorious Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Yet we are in doubt what ſhall be done with the moſt Bloody Traitors? The other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their lives (it ſeems) are more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered then their preſent Villany! Spare the Dignity of <hi>Lentulus;</hi> yes, ſo we would, if <hi>Lentulus</hi> would have ſpared himſelf, would have ſpared either God or Man.

I See, O Conſcript Fathers, the Eyes and Expectations of all here fixed upon me; I ſee you concerned not only for your own and the dangers of the Common-wealth (if they are put by) but for mine alſo. Your affection to me is indeed delightful in my miſeries, pleaſant in my grief; but I beg of you by the Immortal Gods, lay it aſide; forget my ſafety, think of your own and your Childrens. If this place of the Conſulſhip be given me, that I ſhould undergo all trouble, ſorrow, torment; I will bear them reſolutely, I will endure them willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whilſt by my Labours, Honour and Safety redound to you and the <hi>Roman</hi> People, I am that Conſul, O Conſcript Fathers, to whom neither the <hi>Forum,</hi> that place of Univerſal Juſtice, nor the Field deſigned for Conſular Buſineſs: Nor the Senate Houſe that Supreme refuge of all Nations: Nor my own Houſe the place for ordinary retirement; nor my Bed was ever given for reſt: No; neither was this Seat of Honour, this Ivory Chair ever empty of the moſt pernicious dangers and ſnares. Many things have I concealed, many have I born, many have I yielded: Many of your fears have I healed with my own pain. And now if the Immortal Gods have
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103391:87"/> thus deſigned my Conſulſhip to expire, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of you, O Conſcript Fathers, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire from a diſmal Maſſacre, your Wives, your Children, and the Veſtal Virgins from the moſt dreadful violence; the Temples, the Shrines, this our deareſt Countrey from the conſuming Flame; If I have now ſnatcht all <hi>Italy</hi> out of War, and ruine, whatever my Fate be, I joyfully embrace it. For if <hi>P. Lentulus</hi> could like his Name by the Fates declared deſtructive to the Common-wealth; why ſhould not I amidſt all, rejoice in my Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by the Fates plainly demonſtrated Eminent in its preſervation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Wherefore, O Conſcript Fathers, conſult your own Intereſt, regard your Countrey, preſerve your ſelves, your Wives, your Children, your Eſtates: Stand up for the Safety and Glory of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, let me alone, ceaſe thinking of me; for I ought to believe that all the Gods who preſide over this City, will reward me for what I have done: Or if it be their Pleaſure, with a ſerene prepared mind I am ready to die. For Death cannot be diſhonourable to the Virtuous, nor untimely to a Conſul, nor miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a wiſe Man. Nor am I yet ſo ſtupid as not to be moved with the grief of my deareſt and kindeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here, with the Tears of all thoſe you ſee ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round me; nor can my Mind be ſo eſtranged from home as to forget my fainting Wife, my dejected Daughter, my little Son, whom the Common-wealth ſeems to embrace as the Pledge of my Conſulſhip: Nor am I unconcern'd for my Son in Law, who ſtands there expecting the event of this Day. I am moved by all theſe, but ſo, that they may be all ſafe with you though I be deſtroyed, rather than that they and we both periſh with the Common-wealth. Wherefore,

All this the diſcoverers have evidenced, the guilty confeſt, you your ſelves adjudged by ſeveral Sentences: Firſt, That you returned me thanks in particular words, and voted that by my courage and diligence the Conſpiracy of moſt pernicious Men was brought to light: Then, that you compelled <hi>P. Lentulus</hi> to renounce the Praetorſhip; that you ordered him, and the reſt of whom you paſſed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be taken into cuſtody; and chiefly that you Decreed a Thankſgiving in my Name, an Honour, that was never before conferred upon a Gown-man. Laſtly, You did but Yeſterday give moſt liberal Rewards to <hi>Titus Vulturtius,</hi> and the <hi>Allobrogian</hi> Embaſſadours; all which demonſtrates that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſtand committed, are with full ſatisfaction condemned by you.

                        </gap>ns and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons incline, you muſt come to a reſolution before Night. How great a Treaſon hath been diſcovered you all know; if in this you think but a few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, you are greatly miſtaken. The miſchief is more widely ſpread than your apprehenſion of it can be; It hath not only overflowed <hi>Italy,</hi> but found a paſſage over the <hi>Alps,</hi> and ſo creeping on with, a ſilent ſtream is diffuſed through many of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. Nor can it poſſibly be ſuppreſt by conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance or delay: Whatſoever be adjudged muſt be put into ſpeedy execution.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I find two Sentences propoſed, one by <hi>D. Sila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that the Plotters ſhould be puniſhed with Death; the other by <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> who (abating Death) offers all the ſeverity of other puniſhments: Both of them, as the honour and greatneſs of the concern requires, have been managed with the higheſt exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. One is of the Opinion that thoſe who have endeavoured to deprive all us, and the whole <hi>Roman</hi> People of Life, to deſtroy the Empire, to blot out the very <hi>Roman</hi> Name, ought not to live and breath one Moment longer: And the Records teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that this ſort of puniſhment hath often been inflicted upon pernicious Citizens. The other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends that Death was never deſigned by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Gods for a puniſhment; but either as the neceſſity of Nature, or the relief of Labours and miſeries. And therefore wiſe men were never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103391:88"/> the Valiant were always deſirous of it. But there are Bonds in Death, and they ſempiternal too, for the particular puniſhment of every heinous Crime. He would have them ſecured up and down in the Free Towns; this ſeems unjuſt for you to command, and difficult to bring to paſs if you do enact it. Yet if you pleaſe, let it be ſo decreed. I will under take it, and hope I ſhall prove the Man who will think it not agreeable to his Honour, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe any thing that hath been determined for the Publick ſafety. He annexeth a great Penalty upon the Townſmen if any one of them get away; he would confine them in dreadful Priſons fit for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch pernicious men. He reſolves that no one either by the Senate or People ſhould endeavour to alleviate the puniſhment of thoſe he condemns: And ſo deprives them of hope, which is alone able to comfort men in miſery; he commands beſides, that their goods ſhould be confiſcated; he leaves Life only to theſe wretched men; which if he had alſo deprived them of, he might (it ſeems) with one pain have extinguiſhed thoſe many miſeries both of Body and Mind, he might have at once delivered them from all the puniſhments of wickedneſs! That therefore there might be ſome reſtraining Terrour upon wicked men in this life, it hath been long acknowledged that in the ſtate of the Dead, there are puniſhments appointed for the Impious: For were there none ſuch, it muſt be confeſſed, Death is not of it ſelf terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Now, O Conſcript Fathers, I ſee what would be my Intereſt. If you purſue the Sentence of <hi>C. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> who hath ever taken that courſe in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth which hath been moſt Popular, I may perhaps (he being the Author and Patron) leſs fear
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103391:89"/> the Popular rage. If the other, I know not what it may draw upon me. But let the advantage of the Common-wealth ſwallow up all the thoughts of my dangers: We have indeed from <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> a Sentence very worthy of himſelf, and his Anceſtors, ſuch an one as may be a Pledge of his perpetual Affection to the Common-wealth. But 'tis eaſy to diſcern between the ſmoothneſs of an harangue, and an intention truly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in reality conſulting the Safety of the People. I ſee a conſiderable Perſon that affects to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an advocate for the Commons abſent himſelf, that he may not Decree Capital puniſhments upon <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens. The Day before Yeſterday he would have them committed, he voted thanks to me, Yeſterday he would have the Diſcoverers receive the greateſt rewards: Now it cannot be doubted, but he that Decrees the guilty to Priſon, the Proſecutor to be congratulated, the Diſcoverer to be rewarded, hath given judgment both as to the Fact and Crime. However <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> conſiders the <hi>Sempronian</hi> Law was made for <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens: But how can he be eſteemed a Citizen who is a Traytor to the Common-wealth? Laſtly, The Author of the <hi>Sempronian</hi> Law, did by the Peoples appointment make ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Common-wealth, by his own puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He is pleaſed to think <hi>P. Lentulus</hi> (guilty of ſuch Bribery and profuſeneſs, nay, of having ſo fiercely, ſo cruelly deſigned the ruine of the Common-wealth, the <hi>Roman</hi> People, and the deſtruction of this City,) not fit to be eſteem'd a Friend to the People. He is certainly a moſt moderate and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſon! And yet he makes no difficulty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>P. Lentulus</hi> to perpetual darkneſs and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, he Decrees that hereafter no one ſhould move for the eaſing of their puniſhment, that none
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103391:89"/> might affect to be popular by a miſchief to the <hi>Roman</hi> People; he adds alſo the Sale of their Goods, that every torment both of Body and Mind, even want and beggery might enſue: Wherefore if you enact this, you give me an Author, an Aſſiſtant, dear, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the People: If you rather chooſe <hi>Silanus</hi>'s Sentence you will eaſily defend me and your ſelves from the reproach of cruelty, I ſhall have it granted that this was by much the moſt favourable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Although, O Conſcript Fathers, what cruelty can there be in puniſhing ſuch a barbarous Treaſon? I ſpeak my own judgment: I would ſo enjoy with you the preſerved Common-wealth, that I being thus earneſt in this cauſe, am not moved by ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mind, (for whoſe affections can be milder than mine?) but a certain proper Humanity and Mercy. For I ſeem to have before mine Eyes this City, this joy of the whole World, this ſupport of all Nations periſhing in one ſudden conflagration: I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me deplorable unburied heaps of Citizens, in their buried Countrey: There I ſee the rage of <hi>Cethegus</hi> carouſing in your Blood. When I propoſe to my ſelf <hi>Lentulus</hi> tyrannizing, as he confeſſeth the Fates once put him in hopes, <hi>Gabinius</hi> in his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Robes, and <hi>Catiline</hi> at the Head of his Army, then have I a dread upon me, to conſider the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable moans of Matrons, the amazement of Virgins, and Children, the diſtreſs of raviſh'd Veſtals: And becauſe theſe ſeem ſo horrible, ſo dreadful, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Mercy compel me to be Zealous, Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be ſevere, againſt thoſe that would perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate theſe things. For I would ask of any one, if the Maſter of a Family ſhould inflict the ſevereſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon a Servant that had killed his Children,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103391:90"/> murdered his Wife, burnt his Houſe, would ſuch an one ſeem cruel and inhumane, or fatherly and compaſſionate: To me he would ſeem barbarous and ſtupid if he did not endeavour to appeaſe his own pain and torture by the pain and torture of the Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine. Thus, if againſt theſe men who would have murder'd us, our Wives and Children, would have deſtroyed every one of our Houſes, and this Manſion-houſe of the Common-wealth, who had contriv'd to place the Nation of the <hi>Allobroges</hi> in the ruines of this City, in the Aſhes of this confumed Empire, if againſt theſe men we be zealous we ſhall be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed merciful: But if towards theſe we will be remiſs, the reproach of the higheſt cruelty in the deſtruction of our Countrey, and Citizens will be imputed to us. Unleſs <hi>L. Caeſar,</hi> that moſt valiant Man, that moſt faithful lover of the Common-wealth, ſhould ſeem to any one more cruel, who but two Days ago, ſaid that the Husband of his own Siſter an excellent Woman, (when he was by and heard it) ought to be put to death: He ſaid alſo that his Grandfather had been ſlain by command of the Conſul, and his Son under Age who was but employed by him: Now what had theſe done? Had they entered into any Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of deſtroying the Common-wealth? No, there was only ſome penſionarying in the Government, ſome contention of Parties. And at that time the Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this <hi>Lentulus</hi> a Perſon of Eminent worth, arm'd himſelf, purſued <hi>Gracchus,</hi> and was glad to be loaden with Wounds that the Common-wealth might not loſe any thing of its Grandeur. But this <hi>Lentulus</hi> hath called in the <hi>Galli</hi> to ſubvert the Foundations of the Common-wealth, raiſed the rebellious Multitude, ſent for <hi>Catiline,</hi> given us to be aſſaſſinated by <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegus,</hi> the Citizens to be maſſacred by <hi>Gabinius,</hi> the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103391:90"/> City to be burnt down by <hi>Caſſius,</hi> all <hi>Italy</hi> to be ranſack'd and deſtroy'd by <hi>Catiline.</hi> And now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks you are afraid leſt in ſuch an horrid Villany, ſo matchleſs and unſpeakable, you ſhould ſeem to have determined any thing too ſevere: Whereas 'tis much more to be feared, that by the remiſneſs of Puniſhment you ſhould ſeem cruel to your Countrey, than by the exactneſs of Juſtice too ſevere upon the worſt Enemies. But thoſe things which I hear, O Conſcript Fathers, I cannot diſſemble. There are words caſt out by ſome, and they are come to my Ear as if they feared I had not Guards enough to execute what you this day Decree.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. All things are provided for, ordered, ſetled, O Conſcript Fathers, as well by my utmoſt care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, as the great affection of the People of <hi>Rome</hi> to retain their Supream Empire, to preſerve their lives and fortunes. Men of every quality, of every Age are flockt together, the <hi>Forum</hi>'s full, all the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, all the Avenues to this place are full. This is that only thing in which (ſince this City was built) all have agreed in one and the ſame ſentiment, except thoſe who knowing they muſt periſh, had rather pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with a Multitude than by themſelves alone. Theſe men indeed I do willingly except and ſeparate from the reſt: For I do not look upon them in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of bad Citizens but of the moſt implacable Enemies.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103391:91"/> Union if fixed in my Conſulſhip and perpetuated in the Common-wealth, I aſſure you no domeſtick miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief will ever aſſault any part of it. With the ſame affection of defending the Common-wealth are all the Officers of the Treaſury, ſtout men got together, all the Clerks who being upon buſineſs brought to the Office, leave their aſſignations to attend upon the publick Safety. The whole Multitude of the Free-born are here, even the meaneſt. For who is there to whom theſe Temples, the Aſpect of this City, the enjoyment of Liberty, the Light they ſee, and the Air they have ever breathed in, are not dear, ſweet, pleaſant?</p>
                     <p n="8">8. 'Tis worth the while, O Conſcript Fathers, to conſider the affections of our Free-men, who have obtained the Rights of this City, and truly eſteem it their own Countrey: Which thoſe who were Born here, and of the higheſt Quality have not conſider'd as their Countrey, but as a City of mortal Enemies. But why do I inſiſt upon this Order of Men, whom Eſtates, Priviledges, and above all, Liberty, have ſtirred up to defend the Safety of their Countrey? There is no Servant who lives in any tolerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Servitude, that doth not tremble at the Villany of theſe Citizens: That doth not only deſire to maintain the preſent State of Government, but as far as he dares, and is able, ſets his Shoulders to the common Safety. And therefore if any be concerned that 'tis reported <hi>Lentulus</hi> hath his Pander to run from one Tavern to another, hoping to hire ſom indigent, raſcally Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: 'Tis true, that hath been tried and attempted; but there are none found ſo miſerable in their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo pernicious in their deſires, who had not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heave the Sedan, carry their Packs, ply their Fare, and have their quiet courſe of life preſerved to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103391:91"/> them. By much the greateſt part of thoſe who attend upon Shops and Inns (I may ſay all of them) do above any thing deſire Peace. All their attendance, their work, their hire, depends upon the Trade and quiet of the Citizens: Whoſe gain, if the Shops be ſhut, is gone; and where is it if they be burnt? Since things are thus, O Conſcript Fathers, the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> People is not wanting, now ſee that you be not wanting to them.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. You have a Conſul preſerved from the greateſt Dangers, Treacheries, the very point of Death, not ſo much for his own Life as for your Safety: All de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and ranks of Men conſpire to defend the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth with their Judgments, Affections, Deſires, Valour, and Votes: Our Countrey ſurrounded with the Firebrands and Darts of this impious Conſpiracy, ſtretcheth forth her ſupplicating hands to you; to you ſhe commits her ſelf; to you the lives of all her Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, the Tower and the Capitol; to you the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of our tutelary Angels, the perpetual and ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piternal Fire of Veſta; to you all the Temples of the Gods, the Shrines, the Walls, and Houſes of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are recommended. Beſides, this Day are you to decide the caſe for your own lives, the lives of your Wives and Children, you Goods, your Eſtates, your dwellings. You have a Leader mindful of you, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of himſelf (which doth not always happen,) you have all Men the whole <hi>Roman</hi> People (which never before was ſeen in a domeſtick cauſe) agreeing in one and the ſame reſolution. Think with your ſelves by how great labours this Empire was founded, with what Valour our Liberty was obtained, with how great bounty of the Gods theſe have been encreaſed, our Eſtates heaped; all theſe, one Night had very nigh ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruined. That this may never be done, no nor
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103391:92"/> thought of again by Citizens, you are this Day to take care. And this I do not ſpeak ſo much to ſtir up thoſe who are ready to run before me, as that my Voice which ought to be principal in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, may be heard to have performed the Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Office.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. But before I return to the Sentence, I muſt add a little as to my ſelf. By how great the Band of Conſpirators is, which you know to be conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſuch a multitude of Enemies have I undertaken: Yet I cannot but think them baſe weak, low, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. But if ever any Power raiſed up by their rage and wickedneſs ſhould prevail over you and the Common-wealth's Dignity, I ſhall never repent, O Conſcript Fathers, of my Actions and Counſels. For Death, which they perhaps threaten me with, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us all, but to that Glory of Life which you by your Decrees have honoured me with, none elſe hath attained. You have given to others the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation of well managing, to me only of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Common-wealth. Let <hi>Scipio</hi> be renow'nd by whoſe Counſel and Valour, <hi>Hannibal</hi> was driven out of <hi>Italy,</hi> glad to return again into his own <hi>Africa:</hi> Or let that other <hi>Africanus</hi> who ſubverted <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Numantia,</hi> two Cities moſt miſchievous to this Empire be advanced with eminent Praiſe. Let that <hi>L. Paulus,</hi> whoſe Triumphant Chariot the moſt noble and potent King <hi>Perſeus</hi> adorned, be eſteemed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable: Let <hi>Marius</hi> be in Eternal Glory who twice delivered <hi>Italy</hi> from being invironed with Enemies and from the danger of ſervitude: Before them all place <hi>Pompey,</hi> whoſe Valour and ſucceſs have run through ſo many Countries and Regions, that they are Parallel with the Travels of the Sun. Yet among the Praiſes of all theſe, ſhall place be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103391:92"/> found for our Glory; unleſs perhaps it be judged greater to open a way for entring into Provinces, then 'tis to preſerve that place into which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors are to return Triumphant. Though in one reſpect forreign Victory is much more deſirable than domeſtick: When Enemies abroad are ſubdued they either ſerve us, or being received into Friendſhip acknowledge themſelves oblig'd: But when once thoſe, who being in the Number of Citizens are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a Rebellious Phrenſie, commence Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to their Countrey, they, if you go to drive them from the deſtruction of the Common-wealth, will neither be reſtrain'd by force, nor appeas'd by kindneſs. Wherefore I ſee my ſelf ingaged in an eternal War with miſchievous Citizens; which I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelf by the aſſiſtance of you, and all good men, by the Memory of ſo great dangers, (which ſhall have a being, not only among the People pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but in the Hearts and Tongues of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) will be eaſily diverted from me and mine. Nor can there any force be found ſo great as may either ſubvert or ſhake the union of you and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Knights, or the unanimity of all good men.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Wherefore, O Conſcript Fathers, inſtead of that command, that Army, that Province, which I have quitted; inſtead of that Triumph, thoſe Enſigns of Glory which have been caſt aſide by me that I might effect yours, and the Cities ſafety; for thoſe Retinues and provincial Gueſts, whom I do at no leſs charge maintain, then I did at firſt procure; for all theſe things, and my moſt eminent affections towards you; for this my utmoſt diligence in preſerving the Common-wealth (the Fruits of which you all now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold) I ask nothing elſe of you, but the Memory of this time, and of my whole Conſulſhip, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103391:93"/> imprinted upon your minds, I eſteem my irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable defence. But if the violence of Villains ſhall deceive and baffle my hopes, I recommend to you my little Son whoſe Safety and Honour ſhall be ſufficiently guarded if you will but remember, he is the Son of him, who preſerved all by his own dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Wherefore, O Conſcript Fathers, for the Supream ſafety of your ſelves, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the ſake of your Wives and Children, for your Houſes and Altars, your Images and Temples for this City, this Empire for the liberty and ſecurity of <hi>Italy,</hi> for the whole Common-wealth, determine, as you began, with care, and valour.

                  <q rend="margQuotes">I Know very well, Souldiers, that words cannot create Valour, a diſſolute Army never became ſtrong, nor were Cowards ever made reſolute by the Oratory of their General: That courage which Nature and Experience have already given you poſſeſſion of, that and no more can be expected in the Exigences of War. If the Glory we aim at, if the dangers which ſurround us do not prevail, all other Exhortations muſt needs be fruitleſs: A timorous Mind, ever ſtops the Ear againſt the advice it dreads. I have therefore called you only to give a little account of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances and of what I further deſign. You know how great a miſchief the ſloth and negligence of <hi>Lentulus</hi> hath cauſed both to himſelf and us, that waiting ſo long for aid out of the City, I could not march into <hi>Gallia:</hi> And now in what poſture our Affairs are, you your ſelves underſtand as well as I. There are two Armies of the Enemy, one is between the City, the other between <hi>Gallia</hi> and us; here, if we would never ſo fain, we can no longer continue, the want of all Proviſions is ſo preſſing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you go, your Swords muſt open the way, I can therefore only exhort you to be couragious and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; when you begin to fight, remember, that you carry not only Riches, Reputation, and Glory, but even your Liberty and your Countrey in your hands. If we Conquer, all things will be ſecure to us, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion enough will be brought in, the free Towns and Colonies will ſet open their Gates. But if you
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103391:102"/> the other ſide fear ſhould make us withdraw, we ſhall find all things as deſtructive: No Place, no Friend will be able to ſave him whom his own Arms have not protected: Beſides, fellow Souldiers, the caſe is not the ſame with them and us: We fight for the enjoyment of our Countrey, Our Liberties, and our Lives: They only to maintain the needleſs grandeur of a few powerful men. That you may now the more couragiouſly engage, remember your former reſolutions; if you had pleaſed, you might have ſpent your Lives in a ſordid Exile, ſome of you might have dwelt at <hi>Rome,</hi> caſhier'd of your Eſtates and Depending upon others; but becauſe this was baſe, and intolerable to the generous, therefore have you purſued the preſent enterprize. Certain 'tis, no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Valour can bring us off; and none but the Conqueror doth by War arrive at the happy rewards of Peace. For to expect ſafety in flight, and that your Bodies ſhould be ſecured when you have laid down your Arms, is the greateſt madneſs that ever was. In a Battle, thoſe who are moſt afraid, are always in the greateſt danger, boldneſs is the ſtrongeſt Rampart. When I recollect who you are, my fellow Souldiers, and take an eſtimate of your Actions, I am poſſeſſed with the greateſt hopes of Victory. Your Birth, your Youth, your Valour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me thus to aſſure my ſelf of the utmoſt ſucceſs: eſpecially ſince ſuch neceſſities drive us on as are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make the greateſt Cowards become couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. We need not fear being incloſed by the Enemy, the ſtraitneſs of this place ſufficiently ſecures us from that. But if Fortune ſhould envy the Merits of our Valour, be ſure not to die unrevenged. Which do you think is better? to be taken and butchered like ſo
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103391:103"/> many Beaſts, or fighting like men to ſell our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies a dear and mournful Victory?</q>
